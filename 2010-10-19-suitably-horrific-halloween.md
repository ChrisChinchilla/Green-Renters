Whilst we don't really celebrate Halloween here in Australia, I had a giggle out of this tutorial for a BP Oil Spill costume! Found at [Instructables][1].  Reminds me of the year I wanted to go to a party as [Lynndie England][2], but my friends vetoed it. Maybe you're having a Halloween party of your own? Check out our green party tips [here][3] and [here][4]
