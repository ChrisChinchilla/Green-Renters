At Green Renters we've utilised house sitters several times when we travel for work or pleasure. Having people stay in your home and look after your possessions and furry friends gives great piece of mind in ensuring security and wellbeing. A few months ago I had the pleasure to meet Lisa and Duncan from [Open Shed][1], a fantastic service which espouses the [collaborative consumption][2] ethos. Individuals get to hire out their seldom used household goods, books and tools and recipients get the benefits for a nominal fee far less that what they'd pay for purchased equipment or tools.

We were intrigued to hear about Lisa and Duncan's plan to live as a 'travelling start up' by housesitting while running Open Shed, enabling them to travel Australia whilst running their business through the essential tools of any small business, a lap top and an internet connection! Lisa and Duncan have travelled to a variety of places including Melbourne, Sydney, Hervey Bay (QLD) and Clare Valley (SA).

The idea originated as Duncan's parents had used house sitters whilst travelling overseas for 6 months. Lisa and Duncan had a look at the various house sitting sites out there (some are free and some require a paid subscription) and started working on a profile to place on the sites that looked the most active. They asked a family friend whose home they had stayed in over a period of time to write a written reference for them and they also both had a police check. Their preference is for longer term house sitting gigs and the house owners tend to either be travelling retirees or people with pets who do not wish to put their pets in a boarding facility. Lisa commented that their situation was one that not many house owners had considered. "Some were looking specifically for retirees as they hadn't considered that people working from home could be house sitters. They'd never thought of people who work from home and would be there for their pets. They also really liked that our travelling was part of our story and change of lifestyle and they quite liked being a part of that".

Lisa explained that essentially people are looking for responsible people who will respect the space and possessions of another person and most importantly their pets. "People want to trust you pretty quickly.  The home itself isn’t the biggest worry, it’s the pets. People are really keen to know that someone is looking after their pets wellbeing". She went on to describe an amusing anecdote of making an animated video of pet photos for one owners' kids which resulted in a requested Skype chat for the owners with their pets "it was quite bizarre, the pets could recognise their voices and kept trying to lick the screen". Another premise they house sat included weekly visited from the pet doctor for the owners collection of tropical and exotic fish. 

The people who used house sitters were equally concerned to ensure that their housesitters were comfortable. Lisa commented 'people really want us to enjoy their place'.  Owners would leave money for pet food, and with the realities of technology, house sitters and owners have each others contact details and can be touch as the need arises. She added that putting things in writing and having a clear conversation about limits and expectations is quite important, including discussion about what to do if an appliance breaks down and etiquette about where you could sleep and could you have friends over.

I was curious to know what it was like to live in someone else's home for an extended period of time. How do you make someone else's space feel like home?  Lisa explained that as 6 weeks was the shortest they would consider for a rental, they prefer to make a place feel like home by putting clothes away (owners will often make space in their wardrobe), put pictures around, set up a working space if there is a desk.  House sitting also allows the opportunity to live in a place which is completely different to what you might have been exposed to previously. Who would have thought a fireplace in the middle of the room would work? Or who would pass up the opportunity to live in a place which included high tech gadgets, such as sound and movement activated lighting, thumbprint entry into the house and a wall screen which could track all consumption? Lisa commented that it really gives interesting insights into people's lifestyles. 

To house sit on a fulltime basis you do need a level of flexibility. Some house sits can end abruptly due to illness or cancelled travel plans and this needs to be considered and accommodated in the eventuality. If you need to be in a certain place at a certain time it may be difficult to accommodation always. You may need to stay with family or friends in between house sits if there are gaps in time.

Lisa states that they will end their housesitting adventures when it is no longer fun. I somehow think that's awhile away.

Tips for housesitting:

*   Write a detailed profile and include a photograph
*   Get references
*   Make sure you have a clear understanding of any financial transactions including who pays for utility bills, internet use etc., preferably in writing
*   Be flexible about where you'll stay and for how long (there are many short stay house sits available)
*   Consider what you will do when you do not have gigs
