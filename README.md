# Green-Renters

## What is this repository?

This repository is a collection of articles and materials which appeared on the Green Renters website. They include:
* interviews
* recipes
* DIY and tutorials to assist in making a rental property more sustainable
* Gardening information and resources 
and basically any issues that we (or our members) felt like writing about that were relevant to the needs of renters in Australia. Renters as a cohort in general are poorly represented both in terms of the realties of their dwellings and the challenges of their status and we tried where possible, to provide a range of interesting content.

## When will you update this content?

We are not writing articles for the website at this time. Basically as Green Renters grew we were in a position to leave full time employment in the hope of making the NFP a sustainable organisation in every sense of the word. To make this financially viable, we needed to focus our energies on paying work which unfortunately, does not include articles.  

We wanted to keep these articles public as they may be of benefit to renters as well as organisations working with renters. If the content is reproduced, an acknowledgement of the original source would be appreciated. We did a heck of a lot of writing and it's always great to have that recognised.

Currently the two founding members of Green Renters no longer live in Australia. Chris and Cate are now residing in Berlin, Germany, where Chris is creating a [board game] (http://chipshopgame.com/about/) and Cate teaches and writes about [cooking] (http://atravellingcook.com). Both are also freelance writers in the tech industry and both are working together to create small scale catering and sustainable food gift boxes for tech start ups and events. 

##But's there's more...

As any organisation does, we have loads of photographs from events, workshops (and workshop materials). As it can be hard to find sustainability resources that aren't done to death, we'd like to share these images with you. You can find them [here] (https://www.flickr.com/photos/127210359@N08/)
