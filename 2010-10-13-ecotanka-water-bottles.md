I'm always somewhat wary when purchasing drinks bottles in regard to where they are made, what materials are used and whether the bottle leaks. The bottles are made in New Zealand and are made of food grade stainless steel, 100% BPA free, safe, non-toxic and non-leaching. I like that it doesn't retain taste or odour like some cold drink bottles I've had in the past and no leaks so far, so good.

  ECOtankas are very easy to care for, simply wash and rinse as you would your dishes, or place in the dishwasher.Â  Alternatively, baking soda and warm water can be used to cleanse and freshen your bottle, they may be sterilised with boiling water.
