As a landlord I would never allow a tenant to paint or re-carpet a tenanted house or unit.  They had a choice to enter or not enter a lease.  They rarely repair a place to a high standard that it is tenanted to them in.  The colour choice is rarely that of a suitable colour for the tenanted property.  Landlords choose colours to fit the mainstram and that are durable.  Lastly tenants last 2 or 3 years on average, carpets last 10 years, as does paint.  

I am very green oriented and a permaculturalist, and would negotiate for a garden space.
