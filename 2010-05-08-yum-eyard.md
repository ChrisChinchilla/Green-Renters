We came across several great looking products for renters at the recent *Go Green Expo*, more to follow, but in the meantime one of the companies exhibiting offered to extend their show special prices to our readers until the end of May... The **Yum eYard**.

It's perfect for those wishing to grow a veggie garden but have very little space, a concreted back yard or if you're unsure on how long you be staying in a property but would still like to have a veggie patch. Not only that, the casing is made out of recycled print cartridges, so really, it ticks all the boxes!

They are simple to assemble (and dis-assemble), the soil contained within can be bagged up and also easily transported and come in a variety of sizes and styles to suit different property sizes.
