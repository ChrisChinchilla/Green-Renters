I bought these little birds at St Andrews Markets the other week. Here they are protecting the lettuce and silverbeet.

Pretty flowers grown from seed.

Cabbages, garlic, chives and parsley are all going well.

Celery is ready to harvest!

And to celebrate, I'm making celery soup! We have lots of celery so stay tuned for more celery recipes...
