Living with the lightest carbon footprint sometimes clashes directly with the reality of living cheaply. We all know that alot of organic produce are significantly dearer than their non-organic counterparts.

A vegetarian couple, Christopher and Kerrie, decided to look at the dietary realities of low cost living, spending only $1 per day on food each with no handouts allowed. You can read about their journey [here ][1]. I was shocked that they couldn't afford store bought bread (having always been taught that it's cheaper than making your own) or fresh fruit and vegetables. It's an extremely interesting story that has recieved quite a bit of press such as [this][2] article in the New York Times.
