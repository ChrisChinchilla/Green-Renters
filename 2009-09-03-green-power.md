I've been doing some research into Green Power in Australia as I was under the impression that, with our reliance on Coal and a lack of government guidance, it wasn't really worth it. Fortunately, it seems I was wrong and that it is definitely worth investing in, but where do you start? Most utility companies now are offering alternatives, I came across <a href="http://www.greenelectricitywatch.org.au" target="_blank">Green Energy Watch</a>, which whilst the information was collected in 2007, will give you a good indication of the products available. For guidance on policy and government initiatives, take a look at <a href="http://www.greenpower.gov.au" target="_blank">www.greenpower.gov.au</a>
