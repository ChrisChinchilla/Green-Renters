Some people store their money in property, bonds or shares. Others in gold, collectible trinkets and jewels. I've realised that along side the many investments we can make, there is another living option. A treasure trove in trees. Over the past three years I've been beavering away saplings of trees. An investment you ask? How so?

Well it isn't an investment I'd bet my superannuation on but a punt on the future none the less. I've been buying small saplings of fruit and other edible trees at very little cost. My little movable tree investment includes - olive, bay, citrus, guava, Â kaffir, avocado, juniper and curry trees. Then there are the shrubs like blueberry and potted raspberry canes. Recently I added a tiny Christmas tree.

A few of the trees are now pretty sizable and fingers crossed, by the time I have my own place they will be ready to plant in the ground. By buying in advance and putting in the love and care over a few years I estimate I would have saved myself about $800 so far. Buying small (and very cheap) saplings means that I won't have to fork out at least $40 to $100 or more per established tree.

**Favourite edible trees for pots:**

*   Dwarf variety root stock for citrus, apples, pears, pomegranate
*   Berry shrubs
*   Bay trees
*   Olive trees - they hate having 'wet feet' and love the drainage in pots
