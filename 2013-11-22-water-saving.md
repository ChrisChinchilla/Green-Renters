*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Turn down your hot water thermostat by 1 degrees in winter and more in summer</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Only was full loads of clothing</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Wash clothing only in cold water</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Instal a water efficient shower head</span>
