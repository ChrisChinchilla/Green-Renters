Some time ago now I attended a meeting of the [Food Gardeners Alliance][1], which was very interesting. One of the attendees then delivered a talk on keeping chickens in your back yard, something that requires less space than you may think, so here's a few hints and tips...

*   Investigate and double check your local council's policy on <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_2">keeping</span> animals, there's no point getting everything in place to then find you've done something illegal and having to get rid of all your hard work.
*   Chickens will eat scraps of food, in fact pretty much anything you feed them, such as newspaper and other bits of non-toxic rubbish.
*   As with most other species in the animal <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_3">kingdom</span>, what goes in, comes out at the other end and chicken manure is extremely good for the garden.
*   It's probably not a good idea to keep Roosters, especially in smaller properties, they're noisy, <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_4">aggressive</span> and don't give you any eggs!
*   Check the closeness of coups to neighbouring properties and also <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">check</span> with your neighbors before going ahead with keeping chickens, again there's no point embarking on an <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_6">endeavour</span> and then being forced to stop due to a neighbourly complaint.
*   Keep the chickens, coup and their surrounding area clean and pests under control with normal and cheap powders and tablets from your vet. If a chicken is very ill or dies, take it to a vet straight away do discover the cause and to prevent spreading.
*   Keep the coup secure to save the chickens from foxes, mice and rats. Don't cut back on costs by using low <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_7">gauge</span> netting, wire or locks. Keeping the coup clean and free of excess food will help keep away rodents.
*   Chickens food consumption and egg production depends on many things including season, light, temperature and what you feed them.
*   Aside from pellets, they need greens and vegetables. Silver beet is great for this, feeding fresh vegetables means more yellow yolks and <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_8">protein filled</span> eggs.
*   Where do you get your chickens from : From farms, $15-30 per chicken on point of laying, or somewhat past it for $1.50, but these chickens will have a lower egg production
*   A chicken's good laying time is between 2 and 15 years.
*   To stop chickens flying, trim the edges of their feathers, this puts them off balance and stops them flying.
*   There's no real minimum for space, but the larger space and run the better.
*   You will need at least two, chickens are social animals.
