Here's a rather controversial idea for <a href="http://www.desighttp://www.designsponge.com/2009/04/diy-idea-paint-strip-wall-decoration.htmlnspongeonline.com/2009/04/diy-idea-paint-strip-wall-decoration.html" target="_blank">recycling Paint chip cards</a>. Most renters can't paint their homes (surely we're not the only one with magnolia coloured walls in the living room?) and this is an interesting way to add colour. Obviously, there are some ethics in how you acquire that many paint chips, but they are given away freely by design and paint companies.

*You can also use them to decorate furnitureâ€¦*
