Green Renters is a not for profit organisations which started in Melbourne, Australia in 2007. It was the brainchild of Chris Ward and Cate Lawrence, frustrated by constantly attending conferences and exhibitions that only provided products and advice to home owners. Green Renters the only organiation specifically catering for the needs and issues of renters, a cohort which has been significantly excluded by the tradtional sustianability movement. It provided advice for those who are unable to make major changes to a property but still intend to spend many years and call somewhere home through a website, social media, hundreds of workshops, projects and events across Australia.

Green Renters strived to provide a space for renters to be part of sustainable living despite the barriers of living in rental accomodation.  Notable activities include a national renters survey, Green Renters expos for people living in public, private and social housing, an International University student challenge in Melbourne, and sold out cooking masterclasses in the Melbourne Food and Wine Festival. 

Chris and Cate now reside in Leipzig, Germany and wanting their knowledge and experience to be of benefit to renters everywhere (including those who may be wanting to start their own campaigns or even organisation) have made this website as an ongoing resource library.

This website favours functionality over style but is a wealth of information of people interested in home sustainability, the needs of renters, green education, and how to start your very own Australian not for profit. Materials are divided into the chapters of :

*   Workshops: (the materials of our most popular workshops, these are offered both for free and with extra material for those wanting to teach them who have a membership
*   Articles: (A selection of our articles from the original Green Renters site, some syndicated from renters blogs by request) 
*   Resources: articles, information and materials which would be of help to anyone wanting to start community campaigns and/or a not for profit organisation. 

We hope that you find the information useful and relevant, well will be adding to it in stages, so do check back. We welcome your feedback. Lastly, if you would like more detailed support or assistance in your own articles and activities, do feel free to contact us to discuss ways we can provide our knowledge and assistance to you. 

thanks,

Cate and Chris
