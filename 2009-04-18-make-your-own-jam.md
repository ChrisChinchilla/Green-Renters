I tried making jam last night with a different recipe and ended up with a rather toffee like peach concoction. I did some internet research and here's my favourite recipe. I like it as it doesn't recipe visiting three different shops to find 'fruit sugar'.

**Quick and easy jam**

**Ingredients**

*   1 lemon, halved
*   500g fruit remove stone or stalk and chop fruit
*   1 1/2 cups (335g) white sugar

  
**Method**

1.  Juice the lemon. Place fruit, lemon juice and the rind halves in a large microwave safe bowl. Cook, uncovered, on High/100% power, stirring occasionally for 6 minutes.
2.  Add the sugar and cook on High/100% power for 20 minutes or until the jam reaches setting point. (To do this, cool some jam on a chilled saucer and run your finger through it. If the jam wrinkles and stays separate it is ready to bottle.)
3.  Discard lemon rind and spoon the hot jam into a clean jar. Invert for 2 minutes then turn upright to cool.
