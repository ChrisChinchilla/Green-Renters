We've been busy with the move to faux-country over the past month so apologies for the lapse in posts. Now settled in regional Victoria, I can focus on re-establishing the rented spade garden all be it in a somewhat cooler climate.

The move itself was as one would expect, painful. It probably didn't help that I had nearly a truck load of potted plants. It was just too hard to say goodbye to so many little guys I'd grown from seed, cuttings or young saplings.  
I know when I plant a tree, or something more permanent, in a rented garden it will be hard to say goodbye. Nonetheless, I plant away in a state of denial as though I'll never leave that rental property. We had been renting our latest place for about three years so in that time there has been lots of love, sweat and tears poured into the garden.Â When you water, shade and worry about plants through 40 degree days to cruel frosts, it is hard not to form a bond.

Nonetheless, there just wasn't room in the truck for everyone...

After giving away what I could to friends and family, you just have to cut your losses. We had to leave behind the olive tree on brink of fruiting which we planted from a sapling, a bed full of beans about to bear their bounty as well as other herbs and vegies that will come to life later in summer. All one can do is just hope the next tenants are gardeners and start over again. I thought about leaving some garden notes for whoever moved in. But what is the etiquette on that? It would be a bit weird telling people what to do in their own backyard, like some granny from the grave guilting you into constant gardening.

So we move on to the new rented spade garden. While I won't ever fully let go of the last garden I have moved to a really beautiful patch of dirt. And most likely my last rental... well let's wait and see about that. We are renting a beautiful big old house in a regional town. It has an established formal front garden and a little bit of room to play with out back. Last week was spent observing where the sun shines, the shady spots and protected pockets. I've been moving my potted plants around to see where they are most happiest. They have their summer homes now which will have to be re-assessed again as the mercury drops in winter.  
As a Christmas treat some of the larger plants will be getting lovely new soil and bit more space as I re-pot them. After Christmas will be time to look at setting up the vegie and herb patches.

In the meantime, we'll be able to use some the herbs we bought from the previous property over Christmas - rosemary, parsley, thyme, basil, coriander and dill. Perhaps some mint in a cocktail or two.

Well, back to country living and the mission to find the perfect patch for the vegies and herbs.
