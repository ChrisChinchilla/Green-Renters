Awesome idea... plant seeds not bombs. 

<a href="https://www.facebook.com/seedbom" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank"><b>Seedbom</b></a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> is lots of fun and comes from </span><a href="http://www.kabloomshop.co.uk/" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">Kabloom</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">, a small design led business based in Scotland. They have developed an ace ethical, eco-friendly and socially responsible way to flower, fruit or veg your neighbourhood.</span>

Simply bomb (well dig a spot) somewhere in the garden, park or office. Then add water and a bit of love and your patience will be rewarded with sprouting seeds. There are scented mixes, wildflower mixes, urban-been attracting mixes and more. I think this could be a lots of fun in rented places and perhaps a great way to get teenage boys into the garden? Perhaps not too shabby for any action hero loving adult blokes also?
