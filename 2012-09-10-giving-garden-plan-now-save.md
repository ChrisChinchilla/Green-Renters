Off to lunch with a friend - it's great rocking up with your own fresh garden gifts. There is nothing like giving fresh gifts from your own garden. I feel proud as punch when I can grow flowers, fruit or veg to give to friends and family.The only drawback for others is that it's hard to shut me up when I start talking about what I've grown... typical of any obsessed gardener!

If you are someone that plans ahead (and face it you have to be if you are a gardener) the other benefit is the $$$ you can save by growing your own gifts. I'm hoping to grow most of my Xmas pressies this year. That means it is** time to start the planning now**, just like Nanna would. Below are some ideas I've already shared on this site. Other ideas I'll be talking about in the coming months so stay tuned to the rented spade...

**For kids**

*   a Mr potato head complete with 'living cress' hairdo
*   their name spelled out in cress or other sprouts
*   insect related stuff (kids love it!) e.g. their own little ice cream tub insect micro-habitat or insect eating plants
*   space ship zucchini complete with 'alien tendrils' made out of shooting beans

**For adults**

*   little <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/01/just-because-you-rent-doesnt-mean-you.html" target="_blank">pots of herb</a>s in fun containers
*   <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/02/terrific-terrariums.html" target="_blank">terrariums</a>
*   seeds that I've saved and will put into jazzy homemade packets
*   pressing garden flowers for framing or for gift cards
*   punnets of summer veg seedlings
*   living <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/03/beautiful-wreaths.html" target="_blank">succulent wreath</a>
*   pickled or bottled summer harvest goodies
*   <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/04/book-pot-plant.html" target="_blank">book pot plant</a>

**For pets**

*   start the <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/search/label/cats" target="_blank">catnip</a> off now to have bunches for renting cats

These are all low cost gifts but that doesn't mean you don't care about your loved ones. We all spend too much at Christmas and planning ahead can relieve lots of stress so we can enjoy our time together. I think it  shows you really care if you've put thought into pressies months in advance.
