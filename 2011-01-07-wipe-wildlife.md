We visited Healsville Sanctuary near the end of last year (you can see some pics on our facebook page). I love visiting there to see the restorative and rehabilitative work that is done with the animals as well as the wider conservation efforts.

Zoos Victoria's campaignÂ [Wipe for Wildlife][1], is a campaign which encourages consumers to switch from being a 'tree flusher' to one who uses only recycled toilet paper. It's hard to believe, but sadly true that 95% of Australians prefer to buy non-recycled toilet paper, often of the belief that recycled toilet paper is harsher to use and less aesthetically pleasing. The Zoo's Victoria campaign encourages people to make the switch by strategically placing rolls of recycled paper around for people to touch and displaying lots of different types of toilets around and photos of cute animals around the Sanctuary and Zoos. Their website even asks you to: "take a picture of your Wipe for Wildlife Zone (toilet!) and add it to our roll of honour to help inspire all the trees flushers to make the switch!"

The simple fact is - our environment is healthier with trees in the ground, and our native wildlife relies on a healthy environment.
