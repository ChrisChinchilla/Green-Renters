We took a few suggestions, but one simple method seems to have been most effective and re-purposes unwanted items, win-win.

Simply take some old CD's and tie them to sticks with string or twine and stick them into the ground.

The only downside is that they tend to only work best when it's sunny, the reflecting of light is what scares the birds away, so during dark days they wont be as effective. Also, birds aren't stupid, so you may want to move them around every now and then to fool those little fluffy blighters.
