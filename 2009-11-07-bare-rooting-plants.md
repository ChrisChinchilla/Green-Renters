Rooting a plant in water allows you to add more green around the house without buying more plants. Simply take a clipping from an existing plant and place it in water. In one week, roots will have begun to grow. Not only do we like the fact that we can spread the greenery (and green) around our house this way, we love the look of rooting a plant in a transparent glass container. via [Apartment Therapy][1]. We've done this at home to good effect with mint and geraniums.
