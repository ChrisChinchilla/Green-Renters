    There it lay, naked and vulnerable, just waiting to be ploughed on a wet and windy afternoon. Oh the delight of the first time, the anticipation, the promise of things to come... yes, yes, yes, our very own garden allotment!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <a name='more'></a>Yep. We finally have our own rented garden allotment in the local community garden. I've desired an allotment garden for an eternity. A little plot of land where we can plant things that struggle in pots and need a bit of space to ramble. A little patch of heaven about 6 by 4 meters that we can poor our heart into and not have to leave behind when we move. For a renter with little space at home, a plot at a community garden is like winning the lottery. Somewhere to put down your roots. Somewhere to plant long term things that you might not risk at home in the ground in case your lease ends or the rent goes up.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As if it couldn't get any better, at the community garden I'm also surrounded by other garden fanatics where all we do is talk gardening. My people, my kinfolk, those who are also obsessed with gardening. My fellow non-garden glove wearing patriots covered in dirt and mulch. No need to waste time talking trivial matters such as our names or occupation. Discussion focuses on the more important things in life:  what are you planting? Is it too early for these seeds? Do you have any spare sheep poo? How did you grow that (and can I have a cutting)?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing we have done on the plot is turn over the soil adding compost, poo and mulch and watering in as we went (thanks to some handsome muscles that didn't take long). When we turned over the plot we discovered gold. A whole bucket of potatoes left by the previous plot owners from whom we also inherited a scarecrow to boot. I'm convinced this is my renting gardener karma coming back to me from leaving so many gardens at previous rentals in much improved conditions.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The first thing we have put on the plot is a bit of infrastructure; a tepee made from branches collected when walking the dog. This will serve nicely for peas now and then beans later on. Next a few marigolds have been added on the border and some horseradish I'd been keeping a pot which was crying to be planted out. It is sure to go crazy. Now the hardest part is ahead, planning what to plant. I'm going to mix it up a bit to create diversity on the plot. This should help with keeping pests at bay. We will have mostly edibles, a mix of annuals and perennials,  plus hardy flowers and herbs  that make for good companion plants (hence the marigolds going in quickly). I'll keep growing herbs at home since they need constant attention and they are what use most frequently in cooking.
  </p>

    It's reassuring to know that if I get stuck with what to plant when I have so much expertise at my finger tips. I'm not referring to the internet or books. Being part of a community garden I now have local tailored knowledge on tap. A constant bubbling brook of wisdom from my fellow community gardeners. It is an exciting time and I feel so lucky to finally have a plot. There is something really special about being part of the community garden that I just can't put my finger on. The act of gardening can be very solitary. This has never bothered me because I enjoy and look forward to time by myself. But when I am surrounded by other gardeners, even if there is no conversation, it feels like somehow I'm in the right place. Where I'm meant to be. With others that understand my love of growing stuff. I suppose it is that ever elusive sense of belonging. Something you can feel but is a struggle to describe. Just like the excitement of finally finding the plot.
