    <span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">I have a lovely life. Each morning my little dog and I go for a ramble around the neighbourhood. Dog preoccupied by her sense of smell assessing who has passed by of late. I waddling alongside enthralled through my sense of hearing as voices from another time and place float around in my head. This morning the voices, pod casts from Radio National*, were discussing the idea of </span><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/bigideas/collaborative-consumption/5251858" style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;" target="_blank"><b>collaborative consumption</b></a><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', serif;">. Plodding along the pavement I wondered how does this all relate to my gardening? </span> <p>
      <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Firstly, let's mull over the meaning of collaborative consumption. Unlike much jargon this term is reassuringly literal in its translation. It seems to be all about using things (the consumption part) in a way that is shared with others (the collaborative part), as opposed to all by your little old self. My favourite example is the humble library. Thanks to the traditions of philanthropists such as Carnegie, if you live in an abundant country like mine each decent size town has a little place where people can borrow books and then return them for others to read instead of everyone in the town having to buy their own books. Naturally, in my case this involves the borrowing and reading of gardening books.</span>

    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Collaborative consumption is not a new idea but as the voices in my head highlighted some consumers are increasingly opting to participate in different types collaborative consumption. These recent examples of collaborative consumption being technologically enabled through  our use of the world wide web. They range from not for profit initiatives such as <a href="http://www.streetbank.com/splash" target="_blank"><b>Streetbank</b></a> (sharing your stuff with neighbours) through to commercial ventures such as <b><a href="https://www.airbnb.com.au/" target="_blank">Airbnb</a> </b>(sharing your home with strangers).<o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">So can one apply collaborative consumption to gardening? </span>
  </div>
  
  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
     
  </div>
  
  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">I believe that depends on how we define consumption and if gardeners are willing to share. For me, gardening is something that I expend energy on (lots of it)  and which I enjoy many benefits from. So I'm consuming through the purchase and gathering of seeds, soil and containers and reaping the benefits of produce and visual pleasure. As far as sharing goes…hmm…that depends on what I have to share.</span>

  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Most gardeners are happy to give advice and share the spoils of the garden such as seeds, veggies and flowers. Even when the advice and produce isn't really desired by others. Would I however hand over my garden to others to do with what they please. I’d like to imagine I'd say yes and open my garden to all. In truth, I know I'd be biting my nails and looking over their shoulder, bossing them around and generally dispensing excessive doses of unwanted advice.<o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">At its heart, this boils down to issues of trust and sharing. In my little garden I trust  my partner and (some) friends and family to get involved in or look after my precious plants but honestly the idea of letting strangers get involved scares me. What if they plant things I don’t want? Would they care for plants the way I do? Even though there might be some gardeners out there that could improve my garden ten-fold I'm just not open to the idea. I think my lack of trust and sharing is not my problem alone. Many of us just don't want to share our toys these days – whether that be gardens, houses, land or even food.<o:p></o:p></span>

  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Then there are community gardens and guerrilla gardening, the most likely candidate for garden related collaborative consumption. Community gardens tend to be plots of land owned in common by consumers (gardeners). Gardeners create and maintain the garden together, sometimes paying a small fee to do so, and consume its benefits.  </span>

  </div>
  
  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Guerrilla gardening  allows for consumers to successively pass on the option to garden to others even though they don't know each other and none of them own the land where they garden. Oh hang on… isn’t that what renting gardeners do to?</span><br />  
  </div>
  
  <div style="margin: 0cm; text-align: left;">
    <span style="font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, serif;">Renters often leave  well tended gardens behind as they move from one rental property to another hoping that the next tenants will care for what we've cultivated. Is this a form of collaborative consumption? Multiple people unknown to each other gardening the same spot all be it at different points in time.  Or is collaborative consumption defined by bring people together to consume at the same time?</span>
