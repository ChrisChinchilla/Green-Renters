A while back we attended a VCAT session on rental rights and tribunals, not sure how may are still relevant, but it's worth publishing.

*   Don't reiterate points that aren't relevant to the hearing, personal issues are interesting, but won't help.
*   Same with costs, don't ask for unrealistic costs.
*   Try to negotiate first, the chances are the relationship will end so you can have a better outcome. It may not be perfect, but is liveable.
*   Ensure you are prepared and have all that is needed, tribunal would rather hear from the tenant. It's actually not a good idea to play on technicalities and obscure regulation breaches, they tend to base outcome on quality and merit of application. 
*   It's a tribunal, not a court, things are expected to be transparent, no secrecy.
*   Defence against eviction
*   Best thing is to ask to see receipts of posting, it may be late and the case could be won.
*   Prove grounds for basis of evictions.
*   Computer systems may have inaccurate records at agent
*   Repairs can be used as a negotiation point, but possibly too late for eviction issues
*   Keep to the issue
*   Saying the tenant can pay doesn't help, you have to avoid financial loss to the landlord and propose a payment plan. This must also include the rent coming, not just what owed this very minute. A good general record of tenancy may help, I.e. proving they've been reliable in the past.
*   Applications for reductions tenancy can take into account hardship of tenant and landlord and who is likely to most suffer from this. This is usually only unplanned hardship.
*   Objection to notices
*   Has to be after the notice period, but the tenant has to object, bring it forward and take it to tribunal.
*   60 days, change of use. Objection is that it's invalid, again has it been served properly. If so, then landlord has to prove grounds, they will need permits, estate agents, proof of family member.
*   120 days, No reason. objection is usually that it's retaliatory, I.e I complained etc and landlord needs to prove it isn't.
*   At the end of a fixed term tenancy any new tenancy still has the old agreement in place and counts as a continuation.
*   Bond claims and compensation
*   Sometimes the most complex in share house situations, all names on tenancy must be served, even if the addresses are known to be out dated or are the current address. It's in your interest to leave forwarding address. Same applies for landlords and owners.
*   Landlords have 10 business days to apply for bond. Tenants may need to make the application for bond themselves.
*   Up to date details rentalbonds.vic.gov.au
*   These can be served by normal post, but registered recommended.
*   Tenants can amend claims at any time, but they most notify the landlord.
*   Failure to maintain a property, a landlord is required to ascertain the property is in good condition at start of tenancy. If there is a problem after something not being maintained for ten tears they may be liable, but they should have been told about it before. But they're not responsible for any damage, but to the thing that is damaged.
*   All repair issues should be noted in the conditions report, all requests should be done in writing, email all ok. Photos are good to.
*    There are working groups with ca and reiv, perhaps producing leaflets, can we input with sustainability issues? Footscray community legal centre.
*   Generally ca/vcat assumption is that if there is something there it would be working, i.e. a stove, heater. You can theoretically ask for compensation on these items not working, buying an electric heater etc.
*   You can claim compensation for urgent repairs, up to $1800. This is done through an application. Should be at tribunal between 2 to 3 days. These can go straight to vcat.
*   Non urgent repairs again should be in writing, from 14 days to undertake if you serve a breach notice on them. Consumer affairs generally good at getting these resolved, they must be contacted for a report first.
*   Others can include locks, ending property without notice (breach of duty), security issues.
*   Issues should be dealt with as soon as possible during the tenancy.
*   Damage against goods, you have to prove you own it, value, depreciation is relevant. Keeping receipts, or take out insurance (follow up with renters insurance again). Encourage tenants to attend sessions.
*   What about business use items?
*   Law in consider to be fairly antiquated, time for reform. Especially around what is consider 'good'.
*   With cates background, could we become an advocacy group, taking tenants to tribunal? This could also be a use of donations?
*   This information can be hard to access, volunteer task to collate some of this.
*   Most facts and figures are available online.
*   Hearing will only happen if a notice isn't agreed to or tenant takes no action.
*   With notices of vacation, there must be proof as to reason, I.e. rent is in arrears,, renovation is happening, family is coming home etc.
*   Bring everything with you to any hearing. Vcat position is to balance all sides, landlord will need to be there or agent needs all facts, repeating vague responses isn't enough, ,I.e. "they need to pay the mortgage" isn't good enough. Vcat usually tries to get tenant to pay up, so the has to be a really good reason not to. The tribunal will try to offer a realistic payment plan. Know what you're asking for.
*   If no reason given, the vacation notice can be declared retaliatory, I.e. "I asked for repairs and then got notice", then a lawyer can turn the case into the court of the landlord, I.e. "prove you're not".
*   Bond claims and compensation
*   Must be made within 10 days of leaving or abandoning or term lease expires. If claims are late, leave can be asked for but you will need to prove a reason. Agents may tend to ask for more than they're expecting. Compensation for damage can be made up to 6 years later. If applications don't match current tenants an adjournment will be called. Names and addresses must be correct and current. Details of what is being claimed must be mentioned, exactly what, itemized. Rent loss (intention to vacate or end of tenancy) vs rent arrears (not paying). Depreciation must be taken into account for carpets etc and their loss of value over time. Compensation can't be used for something else that it wasn't asked for. Claims for old fixtures on old properties will generally be rejected. Not trying to renovate the property at tenants expense. Act says property only has to be kept in a reasonably clean state. Just because something is broken doesn't mean tenant is responsible, it has to be proved that the tenant damaged it, fair wear and tear. A tribunal will only accept invoices, not quotes, must be satisfied that the work is going to be done, not only if the money comes through. Condition report must be signed by property and landlord (). Do annual inspections need to be signed off to? Same applies for tenants and their claims. Photos are helpful.
*   What if there is no audit? No proof. Strong chance case will be thrown out.
*   What about damage reported but not attended to? Again, if there's proof. Unless its a serious issue that causes more damage by not being reported.
*   Danger notices are not the same as nuisance notices. Proof is only a civil one, not legal, the act doesn't have to have happened yet.
*   Nothing in the act that enforces clauses in a tenancy around pet ownership, unless there is damage.
*   You can only get breach orders against items that are mentioned in the act.
*   Jurisdiction is up to 10,000 without using fair trades act and additional fee.
*   What if tenant has made improvements?

And then the following came from a session in NSW:

*   As a tenant in NSW you have rights under the Residential Tenancies Act 2010 and Residential Tenancies Regulation 2010. If you rent in a strata scheme you are also covered by the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996.
*   Attend strata/body corporate meetings
*   Tenants have no legal right to participate in meetings of the owners corporation except with written permission from their landlord. You may consider speaking or writing to those who can vote at these meetings to gain support for things like getting repairs done. You may be able to attend a meeting and speak about a problem you have. 
*   The owners corporation is required to properly maintain all areas of common property. This includes outside walls, shared laundries, stairwells, foyers, lifts and common parking and garden areas.
*   Repairs to individual flats are the landlord’s responsibility
*   If a problem is clearly on common property, write to the owners corporation or their management agent and ask for repairs to be done immediately. Send a copy of the letter to your landlord (or their real estate agent). Ask the landlord to take action to make sure the owners corporation does the repairs. Keep copies of all letters.
*   If the landlord does not chase up the owners corporation to do common-property repairs, you can apply to the Consumer, Trader and Tenancy Tribunal (CTTT) for an order to have the repairs done. In your application you should argue that your landlord’s obligation to do repairs includes getting the owners corporation to do repairs.
*   By-laws are the rules for managing the strata scheme. They are registered with the NSW Land & Property Management Authority. The landlord/agent must give you a copy of the owners corporation by-laws within 7 days of moving into the premises. If not, they can be fined $110.
*   Examples of by-laws are: ‘no pets on the premises’, ‘no access to rooftop after 10pm’, ‘no bicycles to be chained in the stairwell’, ‘all floors to have some form of carpet or floor covering’.
*   Some owners corporations make ‘house rules’ which they expect all occupants to follow. However, if such rules are not registered as by-laws, they are not lawful.
*   Under the Strata Schemes Management Act 1996, the owners corporation can serve notices on owners or tenants to comply with a by-law. If the notice to comply is not followed, the owners corporation can apply for an order from the CTTT for a fine of $550 to be paid by the owner or tenant.

General tips:

*   Greening communal area: sensor lights, trees or outside blinds in hot area, planting a garden
*   General ways to green an apartment:
*   Thick insulated curtains
*   Draught proofing: door snakes, draught proofing tape, weather seals under external doors
*   Install cfl light bulb (including down lights) and a water efficient shower head
*   Wash clothing in cold water
*   Turn appliances off at the wall
*   Warm yourself rather than the room you are in.
*   Balcony gardening-mention Indira Naidoo interview and our workshops!
*   Many corporation by laws do not allow hanging out washing on balconies as it is deemed aesthetically unpleasing. We have heard of the exception of it being allowed if if cannot be seen from the street and permission is attained from 75% of residents! Drying are incredibly expensive and a waste of energy.
*   Install a temporary low clothes line and drying racks. 
*   Plan washing according to weather, not the same day each week. 
*   Consider buying more bedding or towels to reduce frequency of washing.drying. 
*   If apartments are not individually metered for water use you do not get a bill and can be very hard to encourage overall water use reduction for all residents. Important as heating hot water is the second highest cost in a home to heating and cooling and it is hard to monitor costs if you can't 'see' them.
*   Build community within the apartment
*   As collective you may wish to lobby the strata/owners corporation for solar panels/rain water tank 
*   suggest a bulk buying of utilities (each resident commits to use the same utility provider, you ring them and get the best deal)
*   Hold a bbq or drinks night
*   Suggest a veggie patch
*   Hold a garage sale or clothing swap
