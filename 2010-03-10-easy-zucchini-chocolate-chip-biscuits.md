*In our garden we have an over abundance of zucchinis growing! They're easy to grow and great for swapping, baking and making into soups and fritters. Here's one of my favourite ways of using them:*

**Ingredients **

*   125g butter/nuttlex
*   ½ cup (110g) brown sugar
*   1 egg/ vegan egg replacer
*   ½ teaspoon vanilla essence
*   1½ cups grated zucchini
*   1½ cups self raising flour
*   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
*   1 cup instant oats
*   1 cup muesli
*   2 cups dark/dairy free chocolate chips

**Preparation method **

1.  Preheat oven to 180 degrees C.
2.  In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Stir in the egg and vanilla, mix well, then stir in the grated zucchini. Sift together the flour, baking soda and cinnamon, stir into the zucchini mixture. Finally, stir in the oats, muesli and chocolate chips.
3.  Drop dough from a teaspoon onto an ungreased baking sheet. Leave about 5cm between biscuits. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven
