We all know that reusing a coffee cup is by far the best thing to do for the environment when purchasing from your favourite caffeine purveyor. Despite generally saving cafes money if you bring your own cups, they don't always pass those savings on to you, in fact some cafes charge you more! We thought we would set up this map where you can record your experiences of reusable coffee cups and cafes.

It's Melbourne focused at the moment, but feel free to add experiences from anywhere via Google maps, any changes should refresh here automatically, but let us know if you have any problems.

You will need to click the link beneath the map, then search for the establishment you wish to add and finally click 'save to map' to add it... Phew!
