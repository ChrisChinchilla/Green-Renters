I love succulents. For many reasons:

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Drought Friendly
  </li>
  <li>
    Easy to propagate
  </li>
  <li>
    Great for pots
  </li>
  <li>
    Disease tolerant
  </li>
  <li>
    Suitable for indoors and outdoors
  </li>
  <li>
    Lots of varieties with amazing colours, shapes and textures
  </li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: left;">
  Propagating succulents is really easy. You can break of a section of a healthy plant, allow to dry (3 days to a week) and plant in well drained soil. It's a great way to increase your plant supply rapidly and easily. You can find more information on instructables aboutÂ <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Propagating-Succulent-Leaf-Cuttings/" target="_blank">propagating succulents</a>. I'm working on cuttings to be grown into plants in time for Christmas presents.

  Succulents are great for renters as you don't need a huge outdoor garden. See to the left for great examples of planting succulents in odd teacups. We use pots and pans at home with good results. <a href="http://www.apartmenttherapy.com/succulent-tea-party-at-flora-g-82582" target="_blank">Find out more about creating and caring for your won teacup succulents in this Appartment therapy post</a>.
