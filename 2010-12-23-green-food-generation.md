A few weeks ago I was invited to the launch of 'Green Food generation', the new title from <a href="http://www.woodysliquidkitchen.com/home.html" target="_blank">Hayden Wood</a> who has something of a following for his long running series of alcohol related titles and talks.

The launch was impressively professional, I sat there nestled amongst a sommelier from Cutler & co and a number of owners of exclusive establishments from around the country including the head chef of the Adelaide Hilton... And me. We were all incredibly well looked after, with plenty of delicious food, drinks and friendly staff. After explanations of the ideas and motivations behind the title and conversations with some of the interviewees it was time for networking and drinking.

The premise behind the title is to cover and expose numerous exciting organisations and projects from Australia, New Zealand, UK and USA that are attempting to make their production, sourcing or serving of food as sustainable and ethical as possible. Whether it be sourcing local ingredients, handling waste more efficiently, donating unwanted food to the less wealthy or techniques and utility consumption. I would like to have seen a little more discussion on issues such as the environmental impact of meat and dairy consumption, as apart from a few mentions and a profile of Melbourne vegetarian pub, Grumpy's Green, it's something of the elephant in the room of topics. Also, I did find a lot of the profiles slightly repetitive, with a lot of interviewees covering similar subjects and offering similar tips and advice. At the end of each profile is a signature recipe supplied by the interviewee, with not many of them particularly veg friendly or affordable to produce.

The book is beautifully produced, with sections interspersed with illustrations from Hayden's wife. Some of the typography and layout is a little odd and overly justified, but the beautiful photos of delicious food and locations more than make up for it.

As an added bonus, 10% of the book's profits will be donated to <a href="http://www.ozharvest.org" target="_blank">OzHarvest</a>, whose food rescue and redistribution services operate mainly out of Sydney with some national expansion plans in the making.
