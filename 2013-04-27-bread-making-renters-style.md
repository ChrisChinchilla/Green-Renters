Every person I've ever met who bought a bread maker has told me with zealous zeal how awesome and easy they were to use, followed by a look of sorrow as they admitted how much weight they gained. Add to that a small rental kitchen without enough space for a pots and pans let alone a bread maker and a rather wonky oven and I had my doubts. </span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">But I was intrigued to hear about the no knead bread method over at </span><a href="http://gourmetgirl-friend.blogspot.com.au/2013/03/baking-bread-real-deal.html" style="line-height: 1.5;">Gourmet Girlfriend's blog </a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">and instagram account. The recipe originates from Mark Bittman and was reproduced in the </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html" style="line-height: 1.5;">New York Times </a><span style="line-height: 1.5;">and has been tried by zillions of people. I like that we've all made it a bit different and tried different variations. I like that by buying some bulk flour and yeast, I don't need to go out and buy fancy bread. I can store it in a calico bag in the fridge instead of plastic wrapping. I can bake other things in the oven whilst baking the bread like pasta bakes and casseroles (negating the cost of gas) and the house smells amazing. I know what's in the bread and it's preservative free. </span>

**Ingredients**

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">3 cups plain flour</span>
*   1 3/4 cups water
*   1/4 teaspoon dried yeast
*   1 teaspoon salt.

**Method**

1.  Place flour, yeast and salt in a large bowl.
2.  Mix lightly until all ingredients are combined and sticky. 
3.  Cover with plastic wrap or a tea towel and a rubber band (so it doesn't blow away). I pop mine in the warm sun for a bit if I make it during the day but you don't have to. It will bubble and expand and smell rather yeasty.

​<strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Leave covered for 12-18 hours. </strong><img alt="" class="imagecache-WYSIWYG_medium wysiwyg_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagecache/WYSIWYG_medium/wysiwyg_images/tutorial/Image%202.jpg" style="line-height: 1.5; width: 240px; height: 321px; margin: 8px; float: right;" />

**The next day:**

1.  Flour a chopping board. 
2.  Remove the dough and pop onto the board.
3.  Fold it into itself so it becomes a bit more ball like.
4.  Cover slightly with plastic wrap or tea towel and leave for 15 mins. 
5.  Remove and dust top and bottom with flour. 
6.  Return to bowl and leave to proof for two hours coveredwith plastic wrap/tea towel. 

**Two hours later:**

1.  After nearly two hours, heat your oven to it's highest temperature (250C) and put a cast iron pot in* to heat. If it's particularly known to have things stick you can add a little spray oil or olive oil to the bottom and sides).
2.  After half an hour remove the pot (USE POT HOLDERS or you'll end up with a burn like me).
3.  Transfer the dough into the pot with a lid.
4.  Place back in the oven for 30 mins. 
5.  Remove the lid (CAREFULLY) and place back in the oven for 15 mins. 

**Don't have one? Me neither. I've used a ceramic casserole dish with a lid and also a cake tin covered in foil and both have worked fine.*

**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Variations:</span>**

*   I tried using self raising flour rather than plain flour out of curiousity more than anything and it produces a more spongey, cakey bread a bit more like home made muffins. I think it would work well in making French toast.
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">A couple of tablespoons of chopped herbs (I used parsley, rosemary, oregano and thyme) works well.</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Similarily a tablespoon of pitted olives</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Fancy a sweeter bread: add 1/4 cup sugar, 1 cup dried fruit of choice, 1 tablespoon cinnamon to the original mix.</span>
