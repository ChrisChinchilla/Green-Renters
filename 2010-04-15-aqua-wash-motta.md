First up, the Aqua Wash, one of several washing machine detergent and powder alternatives currently available on the market. The Aqua wash contains dozens of tiny ceramic beads that break the water molecules to such a size that the oxygen within them is ionised, effectively filling the water with electron particles that penetrate dirt in your clothes. To put it simply they change the properties of water to enable it to clean dirt without soap.

At $65 a set, the price may initially seem a little high, but one set should last for approximately 600 washes compared to the dozens of washes a typical washing powder packet would offer. Add to that a decreased water footprint, grey water safe run off and the lack of chemicals and the price becomes a little more attractive.

*We'd be interested to know if anyone has used the Aqua wash yet, or if you've used any of the other equivalents such as soap nuts.*

*How do they compare to conventional powders or home made soap?*
