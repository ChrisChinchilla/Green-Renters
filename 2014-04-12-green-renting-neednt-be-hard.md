Since starting Green Renters, one of our guiding principles is always to show that living sustainability in a rental property is not time consuming, complicated or expensive, in fact, that it is easy and will generally make life easier and cheaper.

Throughout our travels we have met many who are emersed in fantastic endeavours in their green lifestyles that are well meaning but sometimes, just that little bit over the top. Unfortunately, these examples are often referred to by many as to why sustainable living is too hard for them.

<span style="font-size:10px;"><em>Aren't images like these done to death?</em></span>

We also have noticed a lack of interesting, imagery about sustainability. Two of the most common images we see are  a pair of hands cupping a planted seedling and a image of a hand holding an energy efficient light bulb. Neither of these make us few particularly excited about sustainability, nor do they provide an impetus towards lifestyle change.

In response we have produced a series of five free postcards featuring photographs of renters in the city of Maribrynong and the Mornington Peninsula Shire. The postcards show people in their homes showing residents undertaking sustainable actions which can be easily adopted by everyone.  They cover a variety of topics with some hopefully amusing images, accompanied by our top tips and links to more resources. The postcards are available through local businesses and community services in both areas. Thanks so much to everyone involved as models, photographers, providers of props and their families!
