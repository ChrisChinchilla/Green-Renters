<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Garage sales are a great way to get rid of unwanted items, meet your neighbours and raise a bit of money.They're also a great way to recycle and divert waste from landfill. There's even a national </span><a href="http://getinvolved.garagesaletrail.com.au/home/" style="line-height: 1.5;">Garage Sale Trail</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> initiative which promotes annual garage sales all around Australia. We've done quite a few at Green Renters HQ, both as fundraisers and for spending money. Here's a few tips and strategies:</span>

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;"><img alt="" class="imagecache-WYSIWYG_large wysiwyg_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagecache/WYSIWYG_large/wysiwyg_images/story/1601577_10151829426481249_826713430_n.jpg" style="margin: 5px;" /></span>

**Before the garage sale**

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Set a date and time. Saturdays seem to be the most popular with public holidays (when people are most often away) best avoided. Unless you have a lot of stuff and a lot of stamina, set an end date. You'll need that time to pack up, and take leftovers to the op shop, count your earnings etc. </span>
*   Decide if you want to include others. Maybe you have friends or family that would like to add some items to your sale. People are more likely to visit a well stocked garage sale. It's also a good option in an apartment block or block of units. 
*   Start gathering the goods you want to sell. Put all the items in a box. If you don’t have to retrieve an item out of the box before the sale, it's probably safe to assume you don’t need it. If you still have the original boxes and instruction manuals for an item, you can probably charge a little bit more for it. Remember, one person's trash is another person's treasure. Even if you think that copy of a Dan Brown book is best served by placement in the recycle bin, it may be the first thing that sells.
*   Be sure the items you're selling have not been recalled or pose any potential hazards. You should avoid selling older cribs, strollers, helmets, playpens, carseats, and baby gates.
*   Check the weather. If it's hot you might want to sell homemade lemonade or include cupcakes. Some people even do a sausage sizzle although you could be left with alot if they don't sell.
*   Make sure items you intend on selling are clean and check for damage.
*   Go through books and pockets to ensure money or important papers aren't tucked away.
*   Stock up on change so that you won't be caught out if people come with $50 notes.
*   Get out all those green shopping bags you somewhow accumulated and newspaper for wrapping fragile items like crockery
*   Plan ahead what you'd like to do with remaining leftovers that don't sell. You could drop them off to a charity or place in a charity bin.

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">At least a week before the garage sale put up posters, send out an email to your email contacts in your city and set up a facebook page. </span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Mention the best items in your ad to show that you have a good variety availabe to and to attract the most people.</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Be clear on when the garage sale will start and if you will except early callers.</span>

**<span style="line-height: 1.5;">On the day</span>**

<img alt="" class="imagecache-WYSIWYG_large wysiwyg_img" src="/sites/default/files/imagecache/WYSIWYG_large/wysiwyg_images/story/_DSC0123%20copy.jpg" style="line-height: 1.5; margin: 5px;" />

*   Make sure that items that aren't for sale are set aside, so buyers don't try and buy them.
*   Although you may have the friendliest dog in the world, it's best to keep them away from your garage sale. Some people are afraid of dogs or are allergic. 
*   Consider whether you want to stick a price on items (use a label) or let people ask you. It's a good idea at the very least for more valuable items so that someone doesn't sell something for $30 that's worth $300 when you are making tea. 
*   If you don’t have time to price everything individually, signs are helpful, such as "all books 50c each" or "all dresses $10", or "anything on this table $1". You also can offer the customers a deal, example: paperbacks 50c each or 3 for $1.
*   Group like minded items together such as books, plates, dresses etc ( a clothes rack is great if you have one). 
*   Hang items like dresses where they are easily seen from the street.
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Don't allow anyone to intimidate you. Be firm and don't reply in an uneasy or uncertain tone. If they offer you less than an item is worth, just nicely mention your price is firm on that item. If you're flexible but hoping someone else will purchase it for your asking price, you can always ask them to swing by later and if it's still not sold, you'll accept their offer. </span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Be aware that putting items aside for people risks no sale if they don't return.</span>
*   Keep cash in a safe location 
*   Keep tables attractive by filing in the empty spots as things get sold. 
*   Tidy up and take leftovers to the charity shop.
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Take down any signs in the street</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Lastly, count your earnings and enjoy a well earned beverage!</span>
