  This workshop explored how renters can save energy and reduce their utility bills. Participants learnt how to read utility bills,<br />find out which appliances are the biggest energy suckers, how to make their appliances work more efficiently and how to resolve issues with energy providers. Participants could expect an energy reduction of up to 30% on their utility bills as a result of making changes in their homes that we discussed in detail.
