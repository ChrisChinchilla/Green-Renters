Our projects and associated tasks that need to be undertaken are found in <a href="http://redmine.org/" target="_blank">Redmine</a><span>, you will (currently) need a separate login for this and if you have already expressed an interest in volunteering with us, you should have received some login details. If you haven't, </span>[please contact us][1]<span>. Redmine is likely to be your main source of information for what's going on and what you can get involved with.</span>

Redmine comes from a software development background and hence some of the terminologies it uses can be a little confusing, we're slowly making them more relevant to how we run things as we come across them.

<span>Once you have logged in you will be presented with the Redmine home screen, there you will see a handful of helpful starting links on the left hand side and a list of the latest projects on the right hand side. In the top menu you will also see links to <a href="http://redmine.greenrenters.org/my/account">your account</a> (where you can turn off email notifications if you wish) <a href="http://redmine.greenrenters.org/my/page">your own customisable dashboard</a> and the <a href="http://redmine.greenrenters.org/projects">full list of projects</a>. Lets continue from <a href="http://redmine.greenrenters.org/issues?query_id=19">the list of volunteer tasks</a> currently open.</span>

<span>Redmine is highly customisable in the way you can view, sort and filter tasks, all these options are available underneath the 'filter' and 'options' drop downs. Here you can play with a dizzying amount of options and please do have a play around, you wont break anything and may find some options that help you.</span>

*Lets have a quick think about the concept of tasks*

*   Tasks belong to projects, some are very loose, i.e. 'Green Renters marketing', some are more specific, i.e. 'Renters Games'.
*   Tasks can also be related to each other or dependent on each other.
*   Tasks have an assignee, to begin with all the tasks in the volunteer list are assigned to all volunteers, but you can pick up a task and assign it to yourself, or indeed someone else.
*   Tasks have a type, or 'tracker', this is fairly arbitrary for our purposes.
*   Tasks have a status, it's helpful to update this so we all know if tasks are waiting for someone to start them, are in progress with someone or are finished.
*   Equally, tasks have a '% done', which can help you track your own progress through a task.
*   Tasks have a priority and a due date, this can help indicate how important a task is.

*Lets open a task, click any of the blue links under 'subject' or '#'.*  
A lot of this will look fairly similar to the listings view we've just seen, but with more detail. Here you will find more information on the task as well as any additional comments and notes left by anyone involved with the task. If you want to change any of the basic details yourself, click the 'update' pencil icon in the top right above the yellow task box. Have a click around a few of the other icons and links, again, you shouldn't be able to break anything…

*Tracking time and progress*  
The most important things to do with tasks are to keep us informed on your progress and time spent, this isn't for keeping tabs on you, but so we know the progress of tasks and also roughly how long things take people if we ever manage to get projects or our operations funded or sponsored. You can track progress simply by updating the '% done' and 'status' as described above and/or you can track time by clicking 'Log time' next to the 'update' icon. Don't worry about being completely accurate, rough estimates are fine.

*Asking questions and discussion*  
We expect that most tasks will require some discussion and feedback between yourselves and us, you can post comments to tasks by clicking the 'update' icon and adding comments and notes in the appropriate boxes, updating tasks will also result in email notifications for all involved, you can even reply to those and comments will also be added to the task.

*In Summary*
