I was amused to come across [this][1] article supposedly about people who live in cold houses by choice. I'm not sure how much of it was about choice or necessity for most of those interviewed but I'm sure many people in rental properties can relate to the challenge of living in a cold house, particularly those with poor heating facilities in their homes. No one wants to sit in one room under a heater all day or be faced with a ridiculously large gas/electricity bill at the end of winter. So how can we keep warm?

**Reduce draughts**  
Many rental properties are without insulation and poorly maintained.  In winter, draughts can account for up to 25% of heat losses. Here are some ways to reduce draughts:

*   Sealing up cracks and gaps (including floor gaps: even covering the floor with a thick rug will help)
*   Sealing unnecessary vents
*   Sealing exhaust fans and outlet grills
*   Sealing unused fireplaces
*   Using the [Draft Stoppa][2] prevents hot or cold air entering from the roof cavity, thus reducing the cold air circulating in your kitchen or bathroom.

One easy transportable method to reduce door draughts is to make or buy door snakes (our double door snakes are great for busy areas, as the door can be opened and closed without the need for adjusting the dooor snake each time).

For the sides of doors and windows adhesive backed foam is a good resource.** **Hardware stores sell it in various widths and thicknesses, and the tape is self-adhesive and easy to install. Simply cut the tape to the length you need with scissors, peel away the backing from the tape and stick it in place. The size and flexibility of tape makes it well suited for blocking irregular-sized cracks.

**Windows**  
Insulated curtains have many[ benefits][3] by keeping out the cold weather and keeping the warmth inside. Ask around your relatives, most people seem to have a spare pair of rubber backed insulated curtains stashed in a cupboard somewhere.

Alternatively you might like to pick up a pair cheaply at a charity shop or ebay or even make your own. Make some ties while you're at it, you’ll want them open in the mornings.[ Here’s][4] a great easy tutorial. Making curtains is pretty much just about sewing straight lines. (This gets easier with practice!)

You can also get a range of removable window pane insulation at hardware stores not unlike the sticky 'Contact' used to cover school books. Some people even claim good success with sealing their window with bubble wrap, DIY style.

Pelmets are also a great way to keep your home warm. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">When we have a heater inside the room during winter it heats the internal air which rises to the ceiling and a convection begins. As this air slowly cools it begins to fall back to the ground level and part of this air will make contact with the glass in the windows on its journey. If you have ever put your hand on a typical window during a cold night you will know how cold the glass is and why any heat which comes in contact the glass will be transferred through the window. A</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> pelmet prevents the warm air from inside the room coming into contact with the glass. In this process it signifcantly reduces any heat loss which may normally occur through the window. P</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">elmets can be made of any material as long as it creates an air barrier. Temporary </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">pelmets can be made with laminate, cardboard, acrylic, polycarbonate, bubble wrap or even a thick </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">and solid scarf. They simply need to be fixed to the wall and reach to or past the curtain. Most </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">pelmets reach over the curtain, however you can also build a hidden or near-invisible pelmet as a </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">single flat strip that sits behind the top of the curtain and just reaches its back edge. Pelmets can </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">prevent 25% of heat loss from a room.</span>

Electric blankets are reasonably low in energy to run compared to other household appliances however there are environmental impacts with regard to:

*   The plastic coated wiring and other components that are used
*   They are often made with synthetic fibres
*   There's some debate as to health issues relating to electromagnetic fields
*   The initial cost of the blanket and then the ongoing costs of electricity
*   The fire/burn/shock risk.

At any rate they should be checked at least once a year for safety reasons.

**More environmentally friendly options:**

*   Woollen underlay blanket (or even another blanket or doona under the bottom sheet)
*   Flannelette sheets
*   Hot water bottle
*   Rice/Wheat Bag
*   Thick patchwork quilts

**General homewarming, energy reducing tips**  
Focus on keeping yourself warm, not your house. Perhaps you’ve seen the doona suits for sale? Or at the very least, layer up with warm clothes to reduce your need for constant heating. Thermals can be a good option too as well as thick socks or slippers.

*   Keep doors closed to keep heated areas warm.
*   If you're making a hot drink only boil the amount of water you'll need rather than a full kettle.
*   Go back to the teapot and enjoy the ritual of making tea rather than constantly using teabags. It's relaxing, cheaper and reduces waste. A tea cosy helps your pot stay hot longer. Tea leaves can be composted or thrown directly on the garden once cooled.
*   Bring out your clothes horse. Using a clothes dryer expends more energy than other house hold appliances; even more than a washing machine.

*   During stationary activites such as watching tv, reading or using a computer, keep a blanket folded on your chair for easy warmth in mere seconds. Got a few couches? Leave a blanket on each! 

Winter is a great time to purchase bulk ingredients (grains, pulses, veggies) and make pots of soups, [stews][5] and curries. Spices such as turmeric, ginger, garlic and chillies help to boost your immune system and keep the body warm. Buy seasonal produce such as beetroot, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, pumpkin and silver beet. It's cheaper, has less distance to travel and is grown in Australia. Bulk cooking can be divided into smaller containers and frozen, thus reducing the need for take away food. Try a soup party with friends or swap casseroles to keep your winter meals interesting.
