*What is Green Renters?*  
Please see [our about page][1]. Please note, we are not Home Energy Assessors or Gardeners!

*Why did you start Green Renters?*  
We started Green Renters as we were frustrated with the lack of information and resources specifically for renters. Much of the mainstream environmental movement focuses what people can do if they are in the position of retrofit their existing home or are planning to build an environmentally friendly home. Most renters are not able to install solar energy or a rainwater tank for example. We wanted to start an organisation where we could talk and demonstrate what renters CAN do to live more sustainably and reduce their carbon footprint.

*How many people live in Rental accommodation?*  
Around 30% of people live in rental accommodation in Australia, and the numbers increase to 70% in urban areas such as the City of Melbourne. Renters by nature are quite a diverse group both by the nature of their dwelling which may include a share house, high rise apartment or unit for example, and their demographic which can include single dwellers, families, students, migrants, people with disabilities, housemates etc.

*Why don't you just move (to a more enviro friendly dwelling)/buy a house?*  
Many renters don't have the option of simply moving house as there are far more people seeking rental accommodation than the number of properties available for rent. Housing affordability is a significant issue for many Australians. Many people cannot afford to buy their own home and others choose not to. We now see what is known as ‘Generation Rent’, people who may not ever afford to own their own home.

*What are the issues for renters?*  
There are currently no minimum standards under the Residential Tenancy Act for rental properties in Victoria. This makes it perfectly legal for a landlord to rent out a property that does not have heating, that is not weatherproof, that has no window coverings or that has no hot water. It does not have to be possible or affordable to keep the property warm in winter or cool in summer. There also is no requirement for landlords or real estate agents to inform prospective tenants about the standard of their properties. Properties can be let sight unseen.

Because of the scarcity of rental accommodation in many areas and the scarcity of legislation about the sustainability in rental accommodation, many renters are reluctant to make any changes to their rental property even those that may be more environmentally friendly and reduce their energy consumption. Some renters are also fearful that if they ask their landlord if they can make changes such as putting in a veggie garden or an energy efficient showerhead it will be seen as improvements to the property and thus a rationale for the landlord to increase the rent.

*Are you saying all real estate agents/landlords are bad?*  
Not at all, we have both come along to green renter’s workshops in the past.

*What can I do to live more sustainability in my rental property?*

*   Turn off all appliances at the power point when not in use
*   Ensure your heating and cooling work most effectively through insulating: seal off gaps around doors and windows, hang insulated curtains etc.
*   You can grow your own herbs and veggies (even in small containers on the window sill)
*   Wash clothing in cold water
*   Take shorter showers
*   Read labels, and shop locally and ethically
*   Swap and share goods
*   Use energy efficient light bulbs and water saving shower heads

*How can I become involved?*  
Sign up to our mailing list, book into a workshop, read our website. We have loads of opportunities to get involved from helping staff Green Renters stalls at events, handing out surveys, running events, writing articles and helping spread the word.
