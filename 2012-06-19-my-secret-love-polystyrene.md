It's not that I want people to keep making it since it so bad for the environment. It's just that I love to re-use it in my garden.  If you are lucky enough to get your hands on an intact whole box, you can create a mini veg patch like my little lettuce garden - perfect depth, superb drainage and exceptional insulation. Over-engineered and free!

The very clever Lolo Houbein, author of small space gardening book 'One Magic Square', suggests placing an inch square of polystyrene foam on a skewer or string and goodbye bug ravished broccoli! The moths think the polystyrene blobs are other white moths and are scared off by the competition.    I tried this polystyrene pest control and it worked a treat, just not so organic. I'm not sure now what to do with my left over polystyrene blobs...a lovely polystyrene necklace to wear in the privacy of my garden perhaps? <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OhYQEP7i-K0/T98fBV5NlqI/AAAAAAAAAVI/IjgGDvEYgzs/s1600/IMAG0074.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OhYQEP7i-K0/T98fBV5NlqI/AAAAAAAAAVI/IjgGDvEYgzs/s400/IMAG0074.jpg" width="238" /></a>
