People's motivation for saving energy to keep warm can vary. Whether its to reduce consumption for the greater good or to benefit the purse, there are plenty of easy ways to reduce your energy use right now. 

<span style="font-weight: 700;">Draught proofing - </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Most rental properties fall into two main camps, with the same end result. Either an old, badly maintained building with cracks, gaps, holes, no insulation and ill-fitting doors and windows. Or a modern, poorly made building sharing at least several of the same characteristics. Bearing this in mind, your rental home is probably losing a lot of heating and cooling on a daily basis. Statistics vary, but probably around 20% of the money you spend on cooling and heating is being wasted, that adds up! Consider draught proofing to be your number one priority to bring your home up to scratch.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Door snakes</strong> – A cliché, but like so many clichés, you've probably forgotten to do it. Door snakes are cheap to buy or to make yourself and are a very simple way to reduce draughts that are also easy to move around and transport.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Windows</strong> – There are several products available to make your windows more efficient barriers, depending somewhat on what kind of window you have. Films that add an extra barrier, tapes that seal up gaps and rattles, insulated curtains and pelmets.</span>

**Boiler lagging** – If you have access to your water heater or boiler, the chances are that it's pipes are exposed, pipes that contain hot water and are losing copious amounts of heat through not being insulated. If you insulate your hot water pipes with lagging from a hardware store or a DIY method you can actually turn your boiler down several degrees, saving energy and money.

**Heat the room you’re in** – If you’re keen to save energy or dollars, there’s no point heating parts of the house you’re not currently using. Though a combination of draught proofing and just keeping the doors shut you can be nice and cosy with no wastage.
