I love a good crumble in the winter. I find it can be hard to eat enough fruit when the weather is cold and stewed and baked fruit is a great way to ensure you are getting plenty. I've used pears in this recipe as they were 99c a kilo. You could of course use apricots, apples, peaches, berries or a combination of fruits depending on the season. You could also add desicated coconut or liqueur to the recipe.

**Ingredients**:

*   1 cup rolled oats
*   1/3 cup flour
*   1/3 cup brown or raw sugar
*   4 pears
*   handful of nuts, sultanas, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds and pepitas
*   1 teaspooon cinnamon
*   1/2 teaspoon ground cloves, all spice, nutmeg, ground ginger
*   1/2 cup water
*   1/4 stick butter/ 1/4 cup of Nuttlex

**Method**:

1.  Core and dice fruit and add to the dish you will be cooking the crumble in. You can peel the fruit but I prefer to leave the skin on for fibre
2.  Mix dried fruit in a bowl with spices then add to fruit and stir.
3.  Add 1/2 cup of water to crumble dish.
4.  Sift flour add to a bowl along with the rolled oats and most of the sugar.
5.  Rub in butter with your fingertips until it resembles a crumbly texture. Add about 3 teaspoons of reserved sugar.
6.  Top the fruit with crumble mix
7.  Put into a 200c oven for about 30 minutes or until top is brown and the fruit is cooked.
8.  Serve hot with cream, custard or yogurt.
