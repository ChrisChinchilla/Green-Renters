**Who resides in your home?**  
Myself, my partner Mark (when he isn’t away working) and a few tropical freshwater fish. Sometimes we also have a housemate.

**Type of property**  
Townhouse, built in the early 90s.

**Location**  
Lyneham ACT

**How long has you lived there**  
Since I moved to Canberra for work, approximately 18 months.

**Favourite room in your home and why**  
The lounge room – with all the cushions, blankets, mementos from travels and pictures of fun times, there is something very comforting about hanging out in there... although sometimes on a sunny Sunday afternoon I move my rocking chair out to the backyard and turn that into my lounge.

**Favourite possession**  
Probably my record player and record collection... which goes perfectly with my rocking chair.

**Biggest challenge of your home**  
In winter, it, like everywhere in Canberra, is freezing and we have a pretty old ineffective gas space heater. In summer though I would have to say, the small backyard. We would love to have a bigger veggie patch and maybe some chooks. Also the spiders... we back on to bush and there are lots of high eves and nooks and crannies for them to build a home in, so they are already starting to pop up in unexpected places – showers, shoes...

**Why are you a Green Renter?**  
As renters there are a lot of things beyond our control, but being green doesn’t always have to be about making huge changes – it is about doing the little things that are easy and use our resources efficiently.

In our house we try and use and reuse things wisely – I hate waste. It is very rare that we throw out food, we try to reuse any packaging we can’t avoid picking up along the way and we catch water in the shower for the garden. We also eat a mostly vegan diet and try and eat food grown locally (we are lucky to have a great local fruit and veg store and markets that sources everything from nearby). I know not everyone has this luxury – but I also always try and live close to where I need to be every day so that I can ride my bike.

**What are three sustainability tips that can help other renters**  
Little non-permanent things add up: this winter, after our landlord continued to ignore our pleas, we invested in a pair of thick lined curtains for our bedroom (where we previously only had broken vertical blinds). We got them on sale for about $50 and I wouldn’t be surprised if we saved that in heating costs – plus not waking up and seeing your own breath in the morning is priceless!

You can grow vegies and herbs nearly anywhere – we have taken over our whole backyard, have a planter box on the balcony and have a little hot house that my Mum gave me for my birthday, which has been great over the long frosty Canberra winter! Eating something you have grown yourself cuts down on the intensive agriculture in far off places – plus it is so rewarding!

Go along to workshops and expos – often you can pick up some great tips, free samples and find out about programs the local council or state government are running. Lots of governments have schemes and programs which include audits and rebates or discounts on appliances or retrofits that your landlord may agree to.
