We use a combination of several systems for book keeping and accounting, all performing roles they would normally perform in other activities.

You can find the latest set of tasks that need to be undertaken on the financials project in Redmine here <a href="http://redmine.greenrenters.org/projects/grfinances" target="_blank">redmine.greenrenters.org/projects/grfinances</a>.  
You can find more details on [how to use Redmine here][1].

**Creating tasks**  
For creating financial tasks (Invoicing, quoting, outgoing payments, expense claims etc.) create a task and assign it to the current book keeper user. Ensure to include as much detail as possible in the task body and attach any invoices or receipt scans.

As you go through tasks, you may need to access Contacts in CiviCRM, there will be a direct link to the contact in the task. Further details on [how to use CiviCRM can be found here][2]. You should have already received login details for CiviCRM but if you haven't, all you need to do is [register here][3], as long as you use the email address we have for you, you will get all the access details you need.

For accounting and book keeping itself, we currently use Xero, it can be accessed at <a href="http://www.xero.com/" target="_blank">xero.com</a> and you should have received login details already.
