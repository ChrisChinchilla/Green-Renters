### Weed Dating = weeding + speed dating

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Finding that special someone to share your life with is hard work. So is weeding. Why not combine the two?</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">That is just what </span><a href="http://www.thegreenhorns.net/" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">The Greenhorns</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> have done. They</span><b style="line-height: 1.5;"> </b><span style="line-height: 1.5;">are an amazingly talented and motivated bunch in the USA that supports young farmers to connect. They started 'Weed Dating' to help young farmers meet up, whether it is for love, friendship or business partnerships. The idea is that you all get together to weed someones farm. As you weed you chat with someone you've never met before. Then everyone swaps place and starts weeding and chatting (or whatever...) with another new person.  I just love this idea and the video the group has made is super quirky: </span><b style="line-height: 1.5;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/50341101" target="_blank">Weed Dating Video</a></b>
