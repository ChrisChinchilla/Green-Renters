**Why do we need volunteers?**  
Volunteers bring huge value to Green Renters by enhancing the quality and variety of services we provide, giving their time, enthusiasm, additional skills, independence of outlook and a fresh perspective Like any not for profit organisation, volunteers are what enables us to carry out the work that we do.

**What are the benefits of volunteering?**  
The benefits of volunteering include the opportunities to learn and develop new skills; give something back to your community and meet a diverse range of people. It's a great way to also expand on your skills for employment and training (all our volunteers receive a professional reference after a period of time).

**What are we looking for?**  
To be honest if you have skills and ideas, we're interested in hearing from you, we have numerous projects and tasks behind the scenes.

**We don't believe volunteers should just be undertaking the donkey work**  
There are plenty of small admin type tasks that need to be done, but we're also interested in having volunteers becoming involved in our key projects and activities, something you can fully immerse and involve yourself in.

**I'm keen! What next?**
