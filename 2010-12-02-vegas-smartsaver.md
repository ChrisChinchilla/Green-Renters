This small water saving device was easy to install with only needing a shifter to tighten. No need for the added expense of a plumber.Â  So if you are relocating very easy to install & uninstall to take with you. Once you have set your taps to the correct temperature for you, you only need to use the flow adjuster on the device to control the water flow. The twist to adjust the flow up or down is simple and easy, only having to remember to turn right for more water or left for less. A simple device that will have water & energy savings over the long term, comes with a lifetime warranty against defects of material or workmanship. The Vegas SmartSaver is not suitable for low pressure or gravity feed hot or cold water systems.
