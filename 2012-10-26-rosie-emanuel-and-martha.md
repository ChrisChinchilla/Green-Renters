**1. Who resides in your home? **  
Me, my partner Emanuel, and our cat Martha

**2.Type of property**  
A small detached house with a huge garden

**3. Location (suburb/state)**  
Watson, Canberra (yes, Canberra, renters' paradise - not)

**4. How long has you lived there**  
We've been here since March this year, and it's our third rented house in 7 years - previous places we stayed 4 years and then 2 years.

**5. Favourite room in your home and why**  
Now that the grim, dreary Canberra winter has burst into a blossom- and leaf-filled, sunny, warm-breezy Spring, our favourite room is our living room/dining room. It's a big, open, uninsulated space with 3 sets of double glass doors looking onto our garden - miserably cold in winter, lovely now.

**6.Favourite possession**  
Hmm... Can I do my top 3 favourite possessions? my beautiful Trek bike (I don't drive, and Canberra has perhaps the worst PT in Australia); my old swirly rose pink Formica-topped table (same as yours I believe, Cate); my Art Deco dressing table, rescued from hard rubbish years ago and carefully sanded and beeswaxed back to glory.

**7. Biggest challenge of your home**  
The main challenge of our current place isn't one specific thing, but rather the general attitude and behaviour of our landlords. They seem to require the property manager to ask their permission for every single little basic maintenance issue, even things as necessary as plumbing problems. Yet they are overseas and can never be bothered responding to the manager's contact in proper time, meaning everything gets delayed. They also refuse all requests for basic but not-technically-necessary improvements to the house (e.g. insulation or even just curtains for the huge windows), despite the fact that this was their home before, and will be again when their overseas job postings end in a couple of years. I suppose it's probably a common problem that landlords find it impossible to understand that just because we rent, doesn't mean we don't deserve a nice home. Or even just a home that's not shitty.

**8. Why are you a green renter**  
well, because I am a green person in general. There are definitely ways in which renting forces you to be greener whether you would want to or not. Not being able to renovate/DIY/generally put your stamp on your home if you owned it, definitely limits one's resource use, and of course NOT using resources, just using what you've already got, is one of the most fundamentally green ways to live, even if it doesn't get talked about that much. But on top of this, our household uses very few cleaning products - things like vinegar and bicarb are good, and when we buy products (we love Orange Power), they are always greywater friendly, i.e. friendlier for waterways. I try to grow what herbs and veg I can in spite of the greedy giant possums that own my garden. But we would love to buy our own home, and the first things we would do would be to install solar power, super-duper insulation and water tanks; plant fruit trees; and paint. All ways to ensure our long-term enjoyment of our home, and to make it beautiful on OUR terms - both things that renting limits or simply doesn't allow.

**9. What are three sustainability tips that can help other renters**

1. Find out about grants, rebates or free installations (e.g. rebates for water tanks, dual-flush toilets installed for free) that your landlord would likely be happy to approve. Local libraries and websites of water authorities can be helpful for this.

2. Landlords often hate vegie gardens, or at least the idea of them, especially if you want to dig up part of a lawn. ALWAYS follow the campsite rule when doing stuff in your rented garden, and leave it in better condition than you found it. If it looks better - more colourful, more homely - than before, then the landlord will be happy. But more importantly, if the soil is in better condition because of things like manure, mulch, crop rotation and absence of pesticides & synthetic fertilizers, then it will be easy for the next tenants to be green gardeners too.

3. Be mindful of how well, or not, your house is insulated (if at all). If the insulation could stand be improved, figure out what things you could reasonably request your landlord do, and what things you could do yourself (curtains that you install, doorsnakes etc will go with you when you move, so think of them as a long-term thing). Because seriously, you can waste a SHIT TON of money on heating when your house isn't insulated properly. It's important.
