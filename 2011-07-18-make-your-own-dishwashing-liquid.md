Making your own eco-friendly dishwashing liquid is very easy, cheap and quick.

**You need:  
**

*   1/4 cup grated soap
*   2 cups hot water
*   1/4 cup glycerin
*   1/2 teaspoon lemon essential oil ( I used peppermint actually

**Method**:

1.  In bowl combine soap flakes and water and stir until the soap is dissolved. Cool to luke warm.
2.  Stir in the glycerin and the essential oil, leave to cool. AS it cools it will form a loose gel. Stir with a fork and break up the gel and then pour into a narrow-necked bottle.
3.  To use, squirt 3 teaspoonfuls into hot running water.
