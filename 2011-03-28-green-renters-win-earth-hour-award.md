We are pleased, happy and honoured to announce that Green Renters won the *Education* award in the inaugural <a href="http://www.earthhour.org.au/wwf-earth-hour-awards/" target="_blank">WWF Earth hour awards</a>, created to highlight inspiring stories of Australians who are "Going beyond the hour".

The award was presented by Peter Garrett (ALP Education minister) at a star studded event in Sydney's Museum of modern art to celebrate the global event that is now Earth hour. It was a great opportunity for us to meet many amazing groups and individuals who are all working in their communities to make a change.

Over the past few months we have been inundated with work and interest and it's a great recognition and validation of what we've been doing as well as demonstrating the growing numbers of renters in Australia who do want to be involved in making a sustainable change. Thanks to everyone who voted for us in the *People's choice* award and whose positive comments and support over the past few months have seen us through a busy and stressful period.

As we move forward and hopefully we gain more interest and demand in our activities we would like to take the opportunity to remind everyone that we are just 2 people, working long hours for very little money, we would love be able to do more and take up all the suggestions you have been making and whilst we know it's a cliche you've all heard from many not-for-profits before, we need resources!

So now is a perfect time to show your support, [volunteer][1] with us, make a [donation][2] or become a [member][3] to help us help you.
