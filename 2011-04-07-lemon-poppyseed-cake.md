A neighbour left a big box of lemons out for passers-by to help themselves to. It's one of the things I really like about our neighbourhood. I often leave our rosemary or other herbs for the neighbours and I've also met a lot of our neighbours through our Garage sales and also the craft exhibition I held at our house as part of last year's Fringe Festival. It's the little things like this that help build community, even when you don't see your neighbours all that often.
