*Ingredients*

*   6-8 large pears
*   2 vanilla beans, split and scraped
*   1.5 cups sugar (add more to taste)
*   1/2 teaspoon cinnamon (optional)
*   Juice of 1 lemon
*   3 clean sterillised jars and lids

*Method*

1.  Core pears and dice into pieces. If your pears are the thin skinned yellow or green ones they shouldn't need to be peeled, however the brown thick skinned ones usually need to be. 
2.  In a large pot, combine the pears, sugar, lemon, cinnamon and vanilla beans  pieces and scrapings. 
3.  Cook over medium heat until the fruit is soft. Remove the solid vanilla beans and using a potato masher, break down the fruit into a smooth sauce.
4.  Bring to a boil and boil for 5 minutes to thicken.
5.  Fill your jars. Wipe rims to remove any residual jam.  Apply lids.

Lovely on toast, fresh scones or in a sponge cake!

 

*Makes approx 3 jars*
