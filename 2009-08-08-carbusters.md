This is my second post on interesting items found overseas. I'm sure we all know that one of the biggest ways we can help the environment is to abandon our cars. I won't go into any more detail here, I just want to tell you about a great magazine I came across in San Francisco (but published in the Czech Republic) that is published by and supports the '<a href="http://www.worldcarfree.net" target="_blank">World Carfree Network</a>'. These are the people that make those 'one less car' stickers, so you've probably seen their handywork around without realising. The magazine is full of interesting and concise articles on issues such as urban planning, artwork and eco towns. Sometimes it can get a little repetitve, but it is a great read never-the-less.
