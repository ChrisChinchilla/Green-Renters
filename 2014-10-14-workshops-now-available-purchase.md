As you may or may not be aware, the founders of Green Renters are currently living in Leipzig, Germany. This means that Green Renters workshops are not being directly facilitated in Australia. We could contract more workshop presenters to deliver our workshops. But we want to do things a little differently. We have seven years experience writing and delivering workshops. We want to share this with you by offering our resources for the use of others including:

*   Councils
*   Corporate sustainability groups and teams
*   Community groups
*   Schools

## Why would you want this?

Green Renters have extensive experience delivering sustainability workshops to a diverse range of audiences including community members of a range of suburbs and municipalities, older people, students, migrants, residents of rooming houses and social housing and corporates. We know how to explain complex information in a way that is interesting and engaging and have a proven track record doing so. 

By sharing this knowledge with your organisation, you will have a ready made workshop that can be delivered by a staff team member or other individual(s). This enables your staff to attain specialist knowledge on a range of sustainability issues and engage with the needs of your community using our workshops. Knowledge will be placed within your organisation rather than always relying on external presenters and our workshops are created with underlying community development principles. 

### What workshops are on offer?

*   Living sustainably in rental accommodation
*   Sustainable living in an apartment

## What do I get?

For each workshop you will receive:

*   A powerpoint presentation suitable for multiple use, supplied in an editable format to enable you to add your logos, contact details etc.
*   Suggested group questions and detailed group activities
*   Presenter notes including workshop running sheet, definitions, FAQ’s, resources. Also all editable.
*   Handouts for participants
*   Details of suggested props or materials and where to buy them
*   Content and images suitable for press releases, articles in newsletters and newspapers, social media etc.
*   A session with Green Renters via Skype to walk through the presentation with the anticipated presenter at your convenience. 

## How much will they cost?

### Local Councils

$500 per workshop or all our 11 workshops for $5000.  

### Corporate sustainability teams

$600 per workshop or all our 11 workshops for $6000.

### Community organisations and schools

Will be assessed on a sliding scale depending on their financials of the last financial year. 

Fees are based on the current costs we charge for delivering workshops and the time spent researching content, editing workshops regularly to be topical and seasonal (and with regard to participant feedback), writing handouts, acquiring images etc. 

The profits from these workshop sales will fund enabling us to offer free access to those in need without funding, something we have always done at Green Renters. This relates to the current process Green Renters is undertaking in ‘<a href="http://greenrenters.org/news/moving-forward-open-road" style="color: #156734; text-decoration: none;">opening</a>’ the organisation. This will help fund these activities to.
