I found this tutorial and it instantly appealed as it adhere to our ethos of mending things instead of throwing out/recycling and buying a replacement product. I've various friends who've dropped their mobile phones in toilets, glasses of beer, washing up water and I'm sure this will appeal to them...

**What You Need**

*   1 small deep depth bowl
*   1-2 cups of rice
*   Rubbing alcohol
*   Anti-static cleaning cloth

**Instructions**

1.  First thing you want to do is remove/disassemble any removable parts, most significantly the battery unit. Taking your device apart will allow you for easier and quicker drying, since the first thing you want to do is remove any surface moisture. Use an anti-static cleaning cloth like the ones used by photographers, which not only prevents any electrical damage, but won't leave any residue.
2.  Fill a deep cereal or soup bowl with rice. Any rice will do, but white rice will probably work the best since the hull has been removed, which allows for better moisture sucking powers (we're a brown-rice household, so we had to make due). Place your device, off/disassembled inside the bowl, with all parts covered and leave overnight.
3.  By morning, your device should be mostly dry inside and out. But to really make sure you've removed all moisture, you're going to do something seemingly crazy: you're going to soak your device in rubbing alcohol. This will help expedite the removal any lingering moisture within your device.
4.  Leave device 1-3 days to completely dry in a moderate temperature, low humidity environment. If you're lucky, after this dry out time, you'll be able to power up your device and invest in a waterproof case and an extended warranty.
