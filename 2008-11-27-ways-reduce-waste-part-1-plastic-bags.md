Pretty everyone these days knows that plastic bags are a no no. In most instances we can avoid them. But how about encouraging other people to stop or at least reduce their usage? I for one am sick of the way retail staff still reach for the bags without thinking. I'm also seeing people use them for everything even fruit that needs peeling.

I know there's been talk about baning them in various areas and some businesses charge for them. [Green bags ][1]are a good start but in reality they're not all that environmentally friendly. But what if you could do more?

Morsbags was started in 2007 by a crafty woman who was sick of seeing plastic bags in local waterways. The wonderful [Steph][2] has decided to get us started with a meet up in January.  
The idea is to get together with people in your local community, drink wine and make reusable cloth bags (from old duvet covers, curtains from charity shops etc) and hand them out to the unsuspecting public for free on specified dates outside different supermarkets.
