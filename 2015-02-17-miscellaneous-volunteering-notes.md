I think we picked these up from an event somewhere:

*   <a href="http://www.volunteering.com.au/" target="_blank">The centre for volunteering</a>.

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Understand your mission and objective and how people can fit into that.</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Treat volunteers as a staff member with description, targets etc. These can be brief and short, but should have something.</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Ensure you have a dispute resolution process.</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">When it comes to time, design opportunities to fit small time commitments. People are seeking different experiences to build on theirs.</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Bite sized and virtual volunteering</span>

*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Most volunteering organisations offer management training.</span>
