As part of the 'save energy, save money' workshop last Monday, Chris and Cate discussed ways that renters can be environmentally friendly in everyday household activities.  One of the items they brought in to the workshop was an 'enviroball', an alternative to using washing powders and liquids for laundry.  I volunteered to test out the enviroball and see just how well it worked compared to traditional washing powder.

The enviro washball is a recyclable plastic ball containing small ceramic stones, and no chemicals or detergents.  Its creators say it works by raising the PH levels of the water which softens the water, and opens up the weave of the fabric allowing  water to move through more thoroughly.  (website: [www.enviroballs.com.au/Washball.htm][1])

I used the washball with a load of clothes in a top loader machine at the local laundromat.  I was a little hesitant pushing the 'start' button without adding washing powder, i felt like i was forgetting something!  And I wasn't too sure if my clothes would come out really clean using the washball alone.  But I was pleasantly surprised  by the results.  For the most part, my clothes looked, felt and smelt just as clean as normal.  The washball also apparently acts as a fabric softener because the PH levels cause the water to soften.  I generally don't use fabric softener anyway, but my clothes did feel soft after this wash.

There were a couple of items the washball didn't clean as well as detergent would.  I had added a gym top to the load, which didn't come out quite as fresh as I would have liked!  Also a white T-shirt still had a little dirt on it after the wash.  I wouldn't add these sort of items next time, but i would definitely use the washball again for regular washing.  It is great to know I could do washing without releasing chemicals into the environment. 

I think this is something that everyone could use happily once they get used to the idea - it is so ingrained in our society that we must use chemicals to clean everything, it takes a bit of getting used to the idea that you can wash your clothes without them.  So even though more soiled items probably still require detergent, the enviro washball is a success for normal washing loads - saving chemical  use, the money spent buying washing powder, and saving water as there is no rinse cycle required.
