Last week we came across *Green Project* an organisation of assessors and installers managed by Enact Energy who offer a plethora of free services and products with only one catch, you need to currently have electric hot water.

Green Project offer energy efficiency assessments, shower head and lightbulb replacement and larger, more commercial products and services if you're interested. Of course to take advantage of some of these services you may need to get permission from your Landlord, so be sure to check.

The project is currently running in NSW and SA but will be arriving in certain parts of Victoria very soon.
