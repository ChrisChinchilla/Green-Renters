Three PDFs are attached to this page:

*   Our Annual report and AGM agenda for 2011
*   The minutes of the 2011 AGM
*   Our financial statement for 2011

The paperwork we need to submit to Consumer Affairs is fairly simple, we also need to vote on three things:

*   Are the minutes passed?
*   Is the financial statement passed?
*   Are we happy to auspice Carrie's project (See minutes)

To do this, we're going to take a slightly different approach for voting, here's what to do:

*   If you've previously created an account, login with those details.
*   If you haven't, [create an account here][1] as long as you use the same email address we always contact you with, you should be assigned appropriate privileges.
*   Go to your user page at [www.greenrenters.org/user][2] and click the 'View Contact Record' link at the bottom of the page.
*   You should see a tab called 'AGM 2011', click it.
*   Click the grey button that says 'Edit AGM 2011', fill in your answers and click 'save'.

That should be it, feel free to change any other details whilst your here and [let us know][3] if you have any problems.

This page will be modified to become the public report back from our AGM and Annual report once everyone has voted, **we will need your answers by July 17th.**

Thanks!
