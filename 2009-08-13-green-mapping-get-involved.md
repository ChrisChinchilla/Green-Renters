Here is another nugget from our recent overseas trip.  I recently met up with a Melbourne developer designing a green map website utilising Google Maps to allow users to view sub-catagories of environmental and sustainable organisations in their area (or other areas of course). Currently the project is in beta but, as he's local, I shall make sure we post about it here when it's ready. In the meantime I came across a flyer in NYC about a similar (and further developed) project called <a href="http://www.greenmap.org/" target="_blank">Green Map</a>. The site is divided into two sections: one containing existing green maps and one showing you how to create your own. As far as I could see there were no Australian entries so maybe it's time we get together and do it. Lets do it!
