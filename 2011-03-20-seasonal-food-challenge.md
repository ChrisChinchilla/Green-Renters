**10 Reasons to Eat Local and Seasonal**

*   Fresh, locally-produced food is more nutritious
*   Protects your health
*   Reduces air pollution and wasteful packaging
*   Reduces our reliance on oil and builds resilience in the face of global warming
*   Helps family farmers
*   Establishes a connection and relationship between producer and consumer
*   Supports the local economy
*   Preserves local farmland
*   Promotes crop diversity and quality
*   Tastes better!

**What the challenge involves**  
Visit the Queen Victoria markets for a sustainability tour of the market. Afterwards in pairs of two, consult your seasonal produce flyer and purchase seasonal produce to the value of $10 with the vouchers provided. You can spend a bit over or under if you need to. Make a snack dish to share (sweet or savory) for our session on Wed 30th March.

If you can't make the market tour, let us know so we can give you a handout, and organise to meet up with your partner for the challenge.
