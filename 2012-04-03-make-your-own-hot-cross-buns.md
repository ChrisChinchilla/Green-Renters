I've never made hot cross buns before but I decided to give them a go. It's definitely not a quick process as the yeast needs a good amount of time to activate. There's something quite magical about watching the dough rise and the taste of homemade buns is definitely lovely. Cook in bulk and store any extra in the freezer for winter.

**Ingredients**

*   4 cups flour
*   15g dry yeast
*   150g dates, roughly chopped
*   70g walnuts, chopped
*   2 tsp cinnamon
*   1tsp nutmeg
*   Â¼ tsp each of ginger, cardamom and cloves
*   250 ml milk
*   2 tbs vegetable oil
*   zest of an orange or lemon
*   2 tbs honey or caster sugar
*   1 egg

**Crosses**

*   3 tbs plain flour
*   2 tsp caster sugar
*   2 tbs water

**Glaze**

*   2 tbs brown sugar/jam
*   2 tbs boiling water

**Instructions**

1.  Warm milk, oil, zest and honey in a small saucepan over medium heat until tepid. Whisk egg through this, pour into the centre of the flour mixture and mix until a large dough ball has formed.
2.  Dust the kitchen bench with some of the extra flour and knead the bread for 10 minutes.
3.  Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with cling wrap and leave to rest overnight in the fridge (preferable) or stand the bowl in a warm, draught-free place for 1.5 hours to allow the dough to ferment and rise.
4.  Remove the dough from the bowl and punch it a few times to remove any air pockets. Knead gently until the dough is smooth.
5.  Divide the dough into half, then quarters, then keep dividing until you have 16 pieces and roll with floured hands into balls. Place on a lined baking tray, cover with a tea towel and allow to stand in a warm place for 40 minutes.
6.  Preheat oven to 220C. Brush the buns with egg/milk glaze. Mix the paste for the crosses and spoon into a small snap-lock bag. Cut a tiny section off the corner and pipe crosses over each bun.
7.  Bake for 20 minutes or until brown. Combine sugar and boiling water for the glaze *(this will be extremely hot, avoid splashes)* and brush over the buns while warm.
