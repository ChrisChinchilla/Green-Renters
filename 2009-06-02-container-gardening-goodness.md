I decided to move some of my cuttings (mint, parsley, nasturtiums) to a sunny window sill.  It's a small window but it gets the most lovely warming afternoon sun.  I've re-purposed an old blender, a cracked flour container and a pot I was given as a gift. I'm waiting to get a punnet of pansies to plant in the olive oil tin.
