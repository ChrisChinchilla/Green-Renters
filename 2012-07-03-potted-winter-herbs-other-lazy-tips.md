With the weather getting cold and wet, I'm not a fan of treking too far from the kitchen back door to gather herbs for dinner (well the dinner my lovely partner is cooking - thanks darling).

Here is my plan for having winter herbs at your warm and lazy finger tips.

You'll need about half a bag of potting mix, the below pots and your seeds/seedlings:

Large yogurt/ice cream container

*   sage & lemon thyme Large yogurt/ice cream container
*   mint of any sort
*   Pot 1 (30 cm) - parsley & chives
*   Pot 2 (30 cm) - dill & coriander or swap both for fennel
*   Pot 3 (15cm) – rosemary I'm also cutting back lots of herbs like tarragon, oregano and the withered up basil to dry for use over winter.

It's too cold to head down the back of our tiny yard to get greens so I've potted up a heap of my lovely <a href="http://therentedspade.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/my-secret-love-for-polystyrene.html" target="_blank">polystyrene boxes</a> with spinach, lettuce and sorrel. Lastly, the chilli plants keep going but I'm sure they'll die back soon so I've cut a heap off to dry and have moved my <a href="http://therentedspade.blogspot.com.au/2012/05/milk-crate-chillies.html" target="_blank">chilli milk crates</a> to a more protected spot, and also closer to the back door!
