Last week I shared [farmer Ted's great gardening idea][3]. This week I have more country genius gardening ideas to share.

If you visit Victoria's Mount Beauty (the name says it all) and waddle along the main street as I did you'll find a fabulous fence made of old mattress inner springs. Right next to the Tawonga South butcher shop there stands a fence made of recycled mattresses, hardly noticed by the buses of tourists that zip by.

This is an absolutely brilliant idea. The mattress inner springs look like fencing, are easy to slot into space and lets face it - who hasn't faced the struggle of disposing of a mattress during their renting history? The spaces between the springs are perfect for growing trailing plants. The mattress can be positioned over soil or even pop a pot at the bottom if you are dealing with concrete. A perfect frame for growing winter broad beans or delicious spring peas.

Unfortunately I was without a camera when I saw the humble but genius Mount Beauty mattress fence so couldn’t take a photo. However I've managed to find you folks the above pic of another clever gardener's mattress fence care of the crew at** **backyard notes blog. Hopefully this will get the imagination pumping.

**Travel tip** -  If you are ever in Mount Beauty forget the scenery, wineries or slopes and head straight for the Tawonga South butcher shop to take in the beauty of the amazing mattress fence...
