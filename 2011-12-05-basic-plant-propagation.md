One of the biggest costs involved in gardening is buying plants from nurseries, but the major cost in retail-sourced plants is the labour in producing them. By removing that expense, you can fill your garden with plants using your loose change. This workshop covers plant & seed collecting, growing from seed, plants from cuttings, division and other simple plant propagation techniques.
