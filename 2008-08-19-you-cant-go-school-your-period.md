  <em>Author's note: this was a campaign I ran a few years ago. Since back then the issue of young women in developing countries and their periods have resulted in some fantastic initiatives, the best featuring women in developing countries having gainful employment making reusable cloth pads. There is still scope for making reusable pads in Australia. Before I moved to Germany I sent a heap I had made (unused of course) to the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne as many refugees cannot afford disposable pads. </em>

  In many areas of the world, access to adequate menstrual supplies is difficult to come by. Many women and girls rely on rags, newspaper, camel skin or nothing at all for their menstrual needs. A lack of sanitary pads can be a big barrier to a girl’s education. <p>
    I was recently told about <a class="snap_shots" href="http://good4girls.org/">Good 4 Girls <img class="snap_preview_icon" id="snap_com_shot_link_icon" src="/sites/default/files/images/t.gif" style="border: 0pt none ; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 1px 0pt 0pt; max-height: 2000px; max-width: 2000px; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: "trebuchet ms",arial,helvetica,sans-serif; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-image: url(<a href="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif" title="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif" />http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif</a>); background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 14px; height: 12px; background-position: -1128px 0pt; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline;" />a non-profit organisation who seek out donors to sew or purchase new, reusable menstrual pads for donations to areas of Africa where these products are needed most, such as schools and refugee camps in Sudan and Kenya.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Providing reusable supplies not only provides a more environmentally friendly alternative for these young women (in areas of adequate water supply for washing), it reduces their dependence on outside aid organizations to continue providing for their monthly needs.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I’m currently organising a sewing-bee to make a stack of reusable pads to be donated. Can’t sew? Maybe you can cut out patterns or iron seams or something. Or perhaps you’d like to donate some fabric (cotton flannelette) and thread?

    In case you have no real idea what I am talking about in regard to a cloth pad, this is one example of a cloth pad from <a class="snap_shots" href="http://healthhomehappy.blogspot.com/2008/02/make-cloth-menstrual-pad.html">Health Home and Happiness<img class="snap_preview_icon" id="snap_com_shot_link_icon" src="/sites/default/files/images/t.gif" style="border: 0pt none ; margin: 0pt ! important; padding: 1px 0pt 0pt; max-height: 2000px; max-width: 2000px; min-width: 0px; min-height: 0px; font-style: normal; font-weight: normal; font-family: "trebuchet ms",arial,helvetica,sans-serif; float: none; position: static; left: auto; top: auto; line-height: normal; background-image: url(<a href="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif" title="http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif" />http://i.ixnp.com/images/v3.43.0.1/theme/silver/palette.gif</a>); background-color: transparent; visibility: visible; width: 14px; height: 12px; background-position: -1128px 0pt; background-repeat: no-repeat; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: top; display: inline;" />.

      If you would like to get involved and join the sewing bee (the first one will be at Chez Cate in early September in Melbourne), feel free to send an email to me: <a href="mailto:ms.cate@gmail.com">ms.cate@gmail.com</a> . At some stage I will design a flyer with all the relevant details.

      <span style="font-style: italic;">I realise this is not about renting per se, but making your own re-usable pads would be an excellent environmental initiative.</span>
