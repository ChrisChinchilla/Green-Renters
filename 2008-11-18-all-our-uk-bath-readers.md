Probably not that many of you, but a great little publication and accompanying website that was passed to me by a friend in Bath :

[www.greenbath.org][1]

 [1]: http://www.greenbath.org/

it provides listings and resources for green and sustainable resources and organisations across the area in a friendly and presentable format, produced by locals for locals!
