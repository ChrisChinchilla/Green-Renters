Ways to make your fridge energy efficient :

*   Don't keep your fridge too cold. A change of one degree can effect energy consumption by 5%. Freezers should operate at -15°C to -18°C while fresh food compartments should be held at around 3°C to 5°C.
*   Cover food and drink to avoid evaporation in the fridge, which can force the compressor to work harder.
*   Keep your freezer filled. Frozen blocks of food keep freezer temperatures more stable.
*   Don't clutter the fridge top; it can hamper the compressor's proper air circulation.
*   Don't put your refrigerator in direct sunlight or next to an oven or dishwasher.
*   Check the door seals. They should be able to hold a piece of paper in place.
*   Defrost the freezer regularly and avoid frost build-ups of more than a quarter-inch.

An old second fridge can consume up to 3 times the energy of a new fridge as well as adding an average of $190 a year to your electricity bill and 1 tonne of green house gas into the environment. As we've mentioned previously, there is a Fridge Buy back scheme in metropolitan NSW where your old working fridge can be picked up and removed and you get $35 rebate. Go to [www.fridgebuyback.com.au][1] for more details. In Melbourne there may still be [no interest loans ][2]for people on a low income to purchase new fridges and [Phoenix ][3] Fridges will pick up fridges in any condition, service them to make them more environmentally friendly and distribute them to people in need.
