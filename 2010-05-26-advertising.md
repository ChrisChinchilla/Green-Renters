Whilst we work extremely hard to find other sources of funding in order to be able to continue what we are doing at Green Renters, currently our only sources of income for the projects we run are our workshops, fundraising events and advertising.

We know it's ugly and annoying, but it's a simple and easy way for our website to earn us some extra revenue to continue. Currently we have two blocks on the left hand side for Google and OpenX advertisements, we work hard to ensure that relevant adverts appear here, but we can't always control what does, so please [contact us][1] if you see anything that is wildly inappropriate and really shouldn't appear again.

Any businesses organisations interested in advertising with us, you can find our rate card [here][2].
