In response to reading about our love of [milk crates][1], a Green Renters reader sent us details of the Milk Crate man, a phenomenon enjoyed by many train commuters each morning in the West. You can see more Milk Crate men [here][2] (scroll down) and [here][3]. Totally amusing and ingenious ways of recycling everyday house hold goods into art! (Aren't you just itching to put one on your roof?!)
