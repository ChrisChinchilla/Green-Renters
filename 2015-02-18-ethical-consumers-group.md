Cate became a trained Ethical Consumers Group guide, here are some random notes from our first session:

*   Coffee second most (legally) globally traded commodity!
*   "free range" certification is actually voluntary, labeling is vague
*   Aluminum production is an extremely intensive product, if recycled aluminum, it's significantly better.
*   Who are the companies behind the brand and what do they do?
*   boycott calls, criticisms, praises for companies.
*   Sometimes grey areas and mixed messages, i.e. Nestle do some things well and some badly. And they may change...
*   Company record is just one part, for example the product and process to create the product, also the ingredients of products. Habitat, genetics, chemicals, factory farming, food miles, packaging, organics, ownership of company.
*   Five principles to guide purchases
*   Does buying/not buying make a difference? Yes, they all add to a whole (food and goods add up to about 60% of household carbon foot print).
*   How much is enough? Buying too much and it's associated waste, avoid unnecessary consumption.
*   What issues are connected to what i buy? Take one issue at a time to avoid overwhelming.
*   What is a 'best buy'? Choose your issues, the ones that work for your values and based on what is available!
*   How do we make lasting change? Slowly, over time, one product at a time. Celebrate good buys and spread the message. Give feedback to companies.
*   Www.ihs.org.au guide to animal welfare.
*   10-15% of food carbon footprint is food miles, is easier to modify and oil consumption
*   Shopping at the market
*   Ask and get the story behind the food
*   Buy in season
*   Orangesandlemons.com / foe seasonal food guide
*   Grow your own (diggers club mini plot)
*   Product of Australia, 100% of ingredients and production in Australia
*   Made in Australia, at least 50% substantially transformed in Australia
*   Ozzie farmers direct
*   Packaging waste, 3.4 million tones each year
*   Waste hierarchy... Avoid, reuse, recycle... Recycle is at the bottom!
*   Take items with you, bags, plates, cutlery, cups, straws
*   Plastics - avoid 3 (PVC), 6 (polystyrene), 7 (other)
*   Beer bottle lids, not recyclable individually, but can be put together, into something else metal.
*   Ingredients - corn and soy form a lot of filler ingredients in food and are often ge (especially USA), from Australia is cotton, canola. Crop contamination, bio diversity. New and unproved, patents and ownership usually owned by large multinationals.
*   If labelled product of Australia and doesn't contain cotton and canola seed, then it should be ge free.
*   Certified organic or biodynamic, its ge free.
*   Greenpeace true food guide.
