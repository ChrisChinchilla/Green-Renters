I was intrigued to find this solar powered table made by [Intelligent Forms Design][1].

 [1]: http://intelligentforms.net/

It can be used to power personal devices such as laptops, ipods and the like. The wheels mean it is easily portable when it needs to be recharged. Unfortunately it retails for $14000US and is not surprisingly rather out of our price range!

Western Australian company [Ecopia][3] has an exciting range of products, many of which can be practically incorporated into the life of renters. I'm particularly excited by the [solar bike kit ][4]which retails for $45 and the [solar torch ][5]which retails at $29.

Perhaps the way of the future?
