I recently came across <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/news/2009/03/gallery_ewaste_recycling" target="_blank">this fascinating article</a> on Wired about where (America's, but probably similar for Australia) gadgets end up. We forget that all those iPod's, phones, computers and gizmos that more than ever fail after 18 months end up somewhere, this was especially obvious to me after a recent trip to the local tip.

The article details a practice prevalent in the US of shipping off discarded goods to Asia to be recycled and reused, which, in itself is a good thing, however a lot of these Asian countries have lower standards, so think about what you are doing before just throwing those omni-present electrical items away...

Here are a few Australian based services that will help you dispose more thoughtfully.
