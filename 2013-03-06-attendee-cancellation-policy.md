We are a non-profit and as such our workshop sessions are often run on very slim margins to ensure best prices for everyone involved, participants, presenters and the organisation as a whole. We often have to buy materials for participants and thus knowing precise numbers helps us shop efficiently financially and to reduce wastage.

**Bearing this in mind, it is extremely helpful if you can let us know if you can no longer attend a session as soon as possible.**

We regularly run sessions, so you may also be able to transfer your bookings to another session, [contact us][1] to arrange that.

*   7 Days notice or more - *Full refund with $10 admin fee (Or cost of workshop, whichever is less)*
*   4 Days notice or less -Â *No refund available*
