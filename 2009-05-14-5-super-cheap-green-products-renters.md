<strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Plastic buckets.</strong>

<span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Less than a dollar each typically and they last for ages. essential for collecting rain water, shower, laundry water and the like.</span>

<strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Tea/Coffee pot.</strong>

<span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">I drink lots of tea. Making the switch to loose leaf tea was a mental challenge at first as I like the convenience of tea bags but I now love the ritual of making my own pot of tea. Saves money and packaging and my hydrangeas love the tea and coffee leaves...</span>

**Cloth napkins and hankerchiefs.**

<span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">I used to get really bad hayfever.  Not fun. I could go through a box of tissues in a couple of days. The expensive super soft ones infused with oils. Not cheap. A big pack of man hankies keeps my nose happy and cuts down on waste to boot.</span>

Cloth napkins are great when we have barbeques and parties and save us from buying serviettes.  You can buy them for next to nothing at charity shops or learn to make your own napkins [here][1]. They are also great as resuable wrapping paper and gifts.** **

<strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">Curtains</strong>

Insulated curtains make a huge difference to rental properties in cutting out heat and cold. Pick up a pair at an op shop or ask your extended family, people always seem to have disused curtains lurking somewhere. Of course, you can also make your own.

**DIY washing powder.**

<span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Eschew the need for chemicals and all the water goes happily on the fruit trees or a patch of your more hardy vegetables. </span>
