Usually it is in pots on top of concrete. I decided to experiment and garden directly on the concrete. </span>

<span>This may seem mad but what I'm talking about is actually a very old idea and more common than you think. It's called no dig gardening. </span><span>The no dig garden has been around for ages. A wonderful gardening philosopher  <a href="http://www.onestrawrevolution.net/One_Straw_Revolution/One-Straw_Revolution.html" target="_blank">Masanobu Fukuoka</a> </span>was a big fan of no dig. The magnificent  Esther Deans digged it and made it groovy in Australia in the 1970s. Lately no dig gardening has had a resurgence and I learnt about it when I took an urban farming course at **<a href="http://www.ceres.org.au/Training/landingpage" target="_blank">CERES</a>.**   <span><span><span>Basically, rather than digging up really crap soil that you need to add heaps of compost and poo to anyway, you build a garden on top of the crappy soil through layering poo, mulch, compost, green clippings etc. A bit like a </span></span><span>lasagna</span><span><span> but you need to add something around the edge to stop it collapsing. If you build a no dig on crappy soil it helps rejuvenate the ground beneath without you digging it up. You just have to be like the Japanese philosopher and be prepared to wait. If you try this on concrete then you need a barrier like cardboard </span></span></span><span> underneath </span>plus some decent edging on the sides so the stuff you are adding doesn't wash away as you water.   <span>So back to my no dig garden. Having created a no dig garden in the back yard on some grass last year, I decided to try a no dig garden in my front courtyard. It is a pretty typical renters courtyard, cement covered in a shallow layer of two inches of compacted dirt and 'turf'. I laid down my layers of cardboard then newspaper, some poo, mulch and compost; soaking each layer before adding the next. Then planted some seeds and seedlings. Then the birds attacked it all so I gave up on the seeds and planted some more seedlings.</span>

<span>A few months later I had front garden (you'll notice I no longer call it a courtyard) sprinkled with glorious fox glove flowers and some spreading strawberries. The beetroot didn't make it nor did the broccoli,  perhaps the no dig wasn't deep enough? I've been pleasantly surprised by the no dig and now like to potter in the front garden. I was inspired following the success of the no dig and stuck some hardy lavender cuttings in the front that are now about half a meter high. I would say the no dig garden, combined with the lavender and of course some pots, has made my once desolate front courtyard into a delightful little place to potter around. Would recommend to other renters. </span>

**My top tips for no dig gardens:**

*   start small - my first no dig garden was 60 cm x 70 cm
*   don't get  caught up in precise measurements and layers- mother nature doesn't
*   only build if you are staying put for at least 6 months
*   costly (about $30) if you don't have access to free/ cheap compost or straw
*   keep it simple - don't bother with stuff like rock dust. Stick to mulch (I like pea straw), poo, compost/ green cuttings and soil.
