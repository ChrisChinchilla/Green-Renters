OK, we know that quite often you don't get a lot of choice when it comes to getting plumbing work done in rental properties, but if you do have the luxury of choice or (more likely) a Landlord who takes so long to do anything you end up just paying for it yourself, then give the Green Plumbers a call. They're specialists in sustainable solutions and love creating community, ticks all the right boxes!
