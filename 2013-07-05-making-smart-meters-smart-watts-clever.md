title: "Making smart meters smart - The Watts Clever"

The smart meter roll out in Victoria has been nothing if controversial. One of the often overlooked potential features of the scheme is the ability for consumers to be able to monitor what they are actually consuming at the source, not through a series of monitors on individual appliances or attached before the meter, many of which we have covered before in previous articles.

So whilst we all wait to see which providers and suppliers allow us access to viewing our usage data a couple of new devices have appeared on the market that report data directly from the smart meter, one of which is the Watts Clever.

The <a href="http://www.wattsclever.net.au/shop/energy-monitoring/wirelessenergymonitor" target="_blank">Watts Clever</a> works by reading signals from the LED light you might have seen flashing away on the front of the smart meter and transmitting them to the wireless receiver, thus it requires a litre bit of fiddling around to install the meter, but the instructions are reasonably clear and understandable and I had ours up and running within 10 minutes.

Pay special heed to trying to seal up allowing any light onto where the transmitter is attached to the meters LED light. As we were occasionally getting massive power spikes showing on the monitor, which may have been something to do with our flakey old power system, but it's more likely light leakage onto the sensor. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">You can view various aspects of historical data up to four months and one of the features I would really like to have seen, was the ability to download or transfer that data to a computer, but at least it's enough to make bill comparisons. </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">I've been running ours for a few months, enough time to receive a bill and see how accurate the Watts Clever was. The periods don't quite match our billing cycle so I've taken a few liberties to get some averages</span>

**June**  
89.24kw / $18.74 (20) / 4.462 avg kWh per day / .937 avg cost per day

**May**  
118.03kw / $24.79 (full month) / 3.8 avg kWh per day / 0.79 avg cost per day

**April**  
3.66kw / $0.77

We currently have a concession on our bill, so cost isn't necessarily the best measure of accuracy, our bill for the quarter (20 Mar - 19 Jun) was 245.923 kWh, with the Watts Clever for the period above showing a total of 210.93 kWh, so allowing for the shorter period it was on for, it's not too off, perhaps reporting a slightly increased cost than was actually on our bill. Maybe taking an average usage per day as reported by the Watts Clever verses our bill would be better, it averages out at 4.131kWh per day, again a fair bit higher than the reported 2.67kWh per day on our bill. I don't necessarily mind if it's over reporting because when the bill arrives at least it's a pleasant surprise! This could be to do with those random spikes mentioned above.

Whilst the concept of a device such as the Watts clever is a great one, for a household like ours where our service charge is almost double our usage charge, it doesn't necessarily help us save very much, but that's more of a problem with our billing structure than the Watts clever itself, there's not much it can do about that!

*An interesting device and easy to use, but with many others on the market now and many power companies also finally starting to offer monitoring services that take advantage of Smart meters, what are your thoughts on how these devices help and can offer a point of difference in an increasingly cramped market?*
