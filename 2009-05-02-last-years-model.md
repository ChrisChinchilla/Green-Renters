I think we'll all agree that gadgets are great, but we are all pretty obsessed with constantly upgrading them, causing massive environmental impact. Primarily due to modern manufacturing standards being so crappy, forcing us to upgrade regularly, but also due to advertising and peer pressures to 'stay ahead of the pack'. As the old adage says, 'If it 'aint broke, don't fix it', so if your old gadget still works and still does what it's supposed to, then don't upgrade... Now there's a site celebrating just that, sticking with last years model.
