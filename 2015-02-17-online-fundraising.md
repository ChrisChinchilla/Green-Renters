I think these might have been taken at an event a few years back when Crowdfunding was a new idea.

*   Personal campaigns need to tie in with social media
*   <a href="http://www.everydayhero.com.au/" target="_blank">Everyday hero</a> is a great Peer to Peer fundrasing tool
*   Donors will engage with you on their space
*   What could the campaign be? Gamification…Contributing to something, add faces, locations? Peer pressure, maybe the auction?
*   <a href="http://startsomegood.com/" target="_blank">Start some good</a> - Crowdfunding for NFPs
*   Crowdfunding is funding from your community / peers, not always from the community of the platform.
*   <span style="font-size: 13.0080003738403px; line-height: 1.538em;">Membership is twice the value of a donation and regular giving.</span>
*   Storytelling - What is yours?
*   Ask, ask, ask… Tweeting is not enough
*   Start fast, then there will be a lull and finish fast. Needs to be full from the start, even if it's fiends and family.
*   Specificty matters, people want to visualise the change they will help make.
*   More time != better, find the right balance (30 - 45 days)
*   Need tangible rewards.
