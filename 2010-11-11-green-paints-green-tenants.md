So, you've convinced your landlord to do some maintenance and repaint the place? Or maybe the landlord has offered to repaint the property before you move in? Congratulations! But will the smelly toxic paints used be worth the hassle? A new paint job can really liven up your living area, but you might be exposing yourself to nasty chemicals that new paint off-gasses for up to three years. And those chemicals, called volatile organic compounds (VOCs), have also been linked to smog formation, and greenhouse gases. How can you paint the place green, without stretching the friendship with your landlord?

The answer is surprisingly simple. Low-VOC paints are now widely available for no extra cost, so it's just a matter of making better choices. Check the web-site <a href="http://www.greenpainters.org.au" target="_blank">www.greenpainters.org.au</a> for the best low-VOC paint options. Low-VOC paints are very washable, won't fade or discolour, dry quickly, and allow you to live in the property while it is being painted. They are ideal for pregnant women, children's rooms, or if you suffer from asthma. Your landlord won't notice the difference when it's time to pay the bill, and you won't have to put up with nasty fumes!

If the painter won't co-operate, or tries to charge extra, ask your landlord to get a quote from an Accredited GreenPainter. These painting contractors have been formally trained and are qualified to offer advice on sustainable paint options. They are licensed, insured and prefer using eco-friendly paints at all times. There are now over 70 GreenPainters in six states, so chances are there's one near you.

GreenPainters can even use heat-reflective products on the exterior that can cut your air-conditioning bills by 50% during summer, and drop the inside temperature by up to 4 degrees. Another benefit is that these paints come with a 15 year guarantee, because they aren't affected by the heat as much, resulting in reduced maintenance costs. That will put a smile on your land-lord's face! If the outside is getting painted, it's a no-brainer!

If all else fails and the only way you will get a repaint is to do it yourself, check the web-site for DIY tips on choosing eco-paints, estimating techniques and where to dispose of paint waste. You can have any colour, as long as it's green!
