Want to start your own Green Renters or another community organisation? This section aims to share real 'how to' information based on our extensive experience. This includes some tips and strategies that you might find useful, and examples of our own work that might be of more use than a vague case study. 

<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">In our usual open style, we will share with you our thoughts on running the organisation including things that worked and didn't, things we wanted to do but never quite got off the ground and some of the realities of the sustainability sector based on our experiences. Over the years we've seen many people start things with a good idea but fail through losing momentum, getting burnt out or discouraged or simply lacking financial viability. We want to share with you a bit about what it's really like to start an organisation from scratch which aims to represent a niche issue and niche cohort. </span>
