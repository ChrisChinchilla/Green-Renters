The idea of washing your clothes without any soap is a strange one for those of us in first world countries. I've brought an [Enviroball][1] along to workshops and had a range of responses from curiosity to disbelief to aversion to the idea alone of washing without soap.

Enviro Washballs are recyclable plastic balls containing small ceramic stones (no detergents/chemicals/bleaching agents). The stones raise the pH level of the water. This softens the water and opens the weave of the fabric. Water moves through more easily and effectively, removing dirt naturally.

  I was skeptical about using one, as I like the smell and feel of clean clothing, especially as I make my own laundry powder. Also  as I am a keen cook and crafter I'm often dropping sauces and glues and paints on my clothing, making washing a challenge! I also wasn't sure how good a wash would come up in cold water.

Well. I have to say, I'm convinced! One washes our clothes once and we don't need to use laundry powder. I think if  I was washing heavily marked items I'd pre-soak them first and maybe add some of my own powder in with the ball. The manufacturer's state the they last about 3 years and 1000 washes. I had these assertions queried at a recent workshop with a group of elderly Chinese residents. 'We know stuff from China is not very good. How can these been any good?". Well, they've been individually tested in Australia and the EU and the results are available from the product website. I find the calculations a bit odd as I certainly don't do 300+ washes a year, more like 50ish.

I'm keen to hear what other people think of Enviroballs. Have you tried one? What do you think? Would you use one? If not, why not? I think the biggest barrier to usage of the Enviroball is it's $50 price tag ($60 plus at some retailers). The price is a deterrent to skeptics who a like to try before they buy. Also they are as I mentioned, manufactured in China which may be a detraction also.
