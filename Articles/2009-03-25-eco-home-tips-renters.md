  <a href="http://www.thegreenpages.com.au" target="_blank">The Green Pages</a> recently published a great list of ‘eco home’ tips, a lot of them were aimed at those building their on homes, so irrelevant to renters, but here are a few higlights relevant to the likes of us.
</p>

*   Upcycle/Recycle - Consider second hand pieces for furniture. An old dresser or buffet could make a great vanity. By visiting some great recycle shops, you may find a treasure trove to inspire the ecomagination.
*   Low flow taps and showerheads - Get your fittings measured up and put in flow restrictors or install some low flow fittings. When getting your plumbing put in, call certified Green Plumber who can answer many of our eco bathroom questions.
*   Eco IS a material change - there are eco option for practically everything, solvent free eco paint, sustainable timber or bamboo cabinetry, recycled glass tiles, screens, blinds, windows, everything you can think of. Do your research on sustainable architecture and eco home products such as those listed on the Green Pages green directory for the green home.
*   Location Location Location - pick a location that's convenient and easy to get to. Close to shops, amenities and public transport will reduce the amount of emissions that come from getting around. Inquire about the council's recycling program.
*   An organic garden brings a vibrant and colourful touch to any eco home. But instead of just the run of the mill vegie patch out the back, having a garden professionally conceived by a landscape architect can add a unique aspect that highlights your own green passion.
*   Save water - Use water wise plants that are native to the area. Water tanks are also great water saving devices.
*   Organic smorgasbord - Mix in your vegies with native plants. Including edibles with native plants is "good for pest management," says Batley.
*   Passive solar for the greens - consider passive solar principles in your garden. Make the most of sunnier areas for plants, while shady spots are great for benches and relaxing.
*   Farmer knows best - Farmers periodically rotate their crops to maximise the use of the soil. You can do the same in your vegie patch, try rotating your vegies through different parts of the garden to make the most of the nutrients in the soil.
