**What does taking your lunch have to do with helping the environment?**

*   Reduce packaging
*   You know what's in your food
*   Reduce food waste
*   Ethical shopping and choices in what you eat

**Tips to succeed in taking your lunch to Uni**

*   **Write a shopping list**: When planning your shopping don’t forget to include enough food for a few lunches. Make sure it’s stuff you like, and wouldn’t mind repeating two or three days a week, to boot. Unfussy, healthy, easily-pulled-together mainstays like bread, sandwich fillings, spreads, pasta, salads, fruits, and vegetables are all good ideas.
*   **Prepare the night before: **Making a simple lunch in the evening will let you sleep longer AND increase the likelihood of a meal you’ll enjoy.
*   **Work out how you will carry your lunch: **There's nothing worse than leaky food going all through your bag!
*   **Invest in resealable, reusable lunch boxes and utensils: **Don't  forget your own knife and fork and spoon and a bottle of water!
*   **Don’t settle for sandwiches: **Variety is the spice of lunch,  so try to change the menu up whenever you can. Portable food  like soups, bento boxes, burritos, make-your-own pizzas, and especially leftovers are vital to making bringing your own lunch a success.
*   **Use leftovers wisely: **One easy idea is to  make double the dinner servings and packing half away for lunch the next day. Most student associations have microwaves for student use.
*   **Pack snacks: **Ahhh … the four o’clock coma.  To battle the snooze, pack one or two light, portable snacks per day. Fruit is ideal for this, but crackers, hummus, vegetables, popcorn, and nuts should be enough keep you from raiding the vending machines. Buy in bulk and pack in smaller containers.

**Things to take for lunch**

*   Seasonal fruit
*   fruit salad
*   yogurt
