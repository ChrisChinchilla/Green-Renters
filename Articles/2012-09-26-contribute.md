We're keen to make this site a community resource, for a community that is disparate, varied and wide spread.

We don't have the resources to do it all ourselves, so if you have something you want to add here, go ahead. You will be asked to add your name and email so we can get in touch with you if need be and you will be asked to prove your human so we don't get inundated with spam, but apart from that, go crazy, write whatever you feel.

Initially anything you write will be approved before being published, this is so we can do a few things bend the scenes but also to ensure that content is relevant and legal etc. After a few posts, you should be approved straight away, but this is a new feature, so we don't want to open the flood gates straight away.

This is very much in early stages, it will need testing and clarifying, but be bold and give it a go. We won't know where the problems and confusions lie until you do.
