The Eden Project works with <a href="http://www.homesandcommunities.co.uk/" target="_blank">Places of Change</a>, a capital improvement programme funded by government agencies which seeks to improve services for people who are homeless. People involved in this year's garden came from homeless charities, community housing and supportive housing agencies and eight prisons. ManyÂ  received vocational training in woodwork, planting and other horticultural skills at community colleges during the course of the project so that they can receive formal certificates in order to get employment.

The garden is divided into 5 different zones and each group had their own area and theme to plan and build. The plants were grown in hostels and on empty plots across the country; trees were donated from cemeteries in East London. In the Food area, a shed made out of recycled bottles is featured in the midst of an allotment garden with climbing vines and vegetables galore.

The Industry zone has a barren area, a growing space and rows of plants. It is dominated by a bank of recycled washing machines which have been turned into a planter. There is a low fence made out of old plastic jugs which have been filled with different coloured water.
