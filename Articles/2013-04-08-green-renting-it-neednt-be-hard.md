We’re running two eye catching, fun postcard campaigns in the City of Maribyrnong and the Mornington Peninsula around the theme of “Green Renting, it needn't be this hard“.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">We’ll be featuring 5 renters (in each municipality) in humorous scenes depicting the extents some might go to make their rentals more sustainable.</span>

The other side of the postcard will direct people to a special website for the campaign which will be full of follow up tips and anecdotes.

We’re looking for enthusiastic renters to be subjects of the photos, ideally in your own home, so sign up below if you’re interested in taking part or just want to be kept up to date with the campaign.
