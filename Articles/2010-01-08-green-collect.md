I would hazard a guess that a lot renters are like us and don't have access to a car, this often makes getting rid of (or should I say passing on or recycling) unwanted goods quite difficult and you you generally end up waiting a year until the next hard rubbish collection. Not only does this clutter up your already small property but most council dumps' green credentials can't be relied upon either.

Enter Green Collect, an excellent service that collects and recycles many of your unwated items and even employs staff from disadvantaged backgrounds, so really, there's nothing to lose!
