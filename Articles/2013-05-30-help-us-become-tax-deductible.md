Yes, we know it's not the most glamorous or exciting topic, but it's a really big deal for our effectiveness to raise funds for running programs.

DGR status (Or Deductible Gift Recipient status) means that any contributions people make towards us can be offset against their tax return, this is good for individuals of course, but we can also start accepting larger contributions from organisations and philanthropic funds as they require DGR status (whether you agree with that or not, it's the way it is right now!).

There are several hoops we need to jump through to get DGR status, one of them is that we need 50 paid members to the organisation and we currently have 42, so to get us over the line we're having a more that half price membership deal for the next week.

You will still receive all the usual benefits for becoming a member (which far outway the cost) and you will help us become a far stronger organisation. Also, bear in mind household members count as 2 members and organisation count as 4.
