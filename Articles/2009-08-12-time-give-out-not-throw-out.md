It's nearly Spring and spring cleaning time. We got a new telly and wondered what to do with the old one. It works fine, it's just old. We tried to sell it but had no offers. None of our friends needed it. Then we thought about calling our local Asylum Seeker charity, [The Asylum Seeker Resource Centre][1], and the telly now has a very happy new home. Asylum seekers typically come to Australia with very little support and resources. It can be extremely difficult for them to access ammenities as they are not eligible for government benefits. Everyday items in good condition such as TVs and white goods are something most of us own and replace on occasion. Next time, rather than taking these things to the tip, give your local charity such as the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre a call and make a difference.

**Mobile Phones**  
Don't throw away your old mobile phone when you upgrade. A number of charities such as [Scope][2], <a href="http://www.mobilemuster.com.au/" target="_blank">Mobile Muster</a> and <a href="http://www.zoo.org.au/Calling_on_You" target="_blank">Calling on You</a> recycle mobile phones by repairing and donating them to  third world communities that have limited telecommunications resources. Good stuff.
