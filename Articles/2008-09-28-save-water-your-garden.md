It's been a long time since we've been able to run through sprinklers, but here's some great tips for reducing water whilst still having a thriving garden:

*   If you have grass in your garden then run hosing from the water outlet pipe on your washing machine on to it to maintain a lovely slab of green turf. If you don't have grass, then collect some of the water into a bucket which can easily be used on non-edible plants.
*   Collect rainwater in buckets or tanks for future use.
*   Group plants on their watering needs to make the most efficient use of water.
*   Check the soil before watering, if it's damp already then save that water!
*   Most plants will not need watering as much as you think, try cutting back and keeping an eye on the plant.
*   Pot plants and house plants need a lot of water, do you really need then?
*   Remove weeds from beds, they'll only use up water plants you actually want need.
*   Water plant roots, not onto foliage.
*   Larger plants and long grass can shield smaller plants from the sun.
*   Use water crystals and wetting agents to keep the soil from drying out.
*   Consider laying compost or mulch to keep soil damper.
*   Plant native or drought resistant plants instead of water greedy European varities.
