I'm a big fan of using orange oil in cleaning. It's a great degreaser and I also use it for removing sticky labels, glue and other messes that I tend to make in crafting and cooking.

There's a lot of different ways of making homemade cleaners. Here's one I've been making whenever I've had a cordial making class and have leftover citrus peel.

<u>Ingredients </u>

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Orange peels </span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">White vinegar </span>

<u>Directions</u>

1.  <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Take a glass jar and pack full with orange peels. </span>
2.  Add white vinegar, wait for it to settle then pop the top on.
3.  Let the jar sit for 10 days.
4.  After 10 days, strain liquid from the jar and pour it into a spray bottle.
5.  Use to clean mirrors, glass, bench tops etc.
6.  Orange and vinegar also work very well as a weed killer, so you could alternatively use it to kill unwanted weeds taking care not to spray any other plants.
