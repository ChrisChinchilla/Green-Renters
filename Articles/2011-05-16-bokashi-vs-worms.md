We've talked many times in the past about composting with worms, the commercial options and the DIY options, previous articles can be found [here][1]. Frankly, worms are great but not suited to everyone and every situation, so for those of you wishing to enter the wonderful world of composting there is always bokashi.

Maze distribution sent us one of their <a href="http://www.mazeproducts.com.au/Products/Indoor_Kitchen_Composter.aspx" target="_blank">bokashi bins</a> several months ago to trial and we've been using it alongside our long standing worm farm to compare and contrast the two.** **

**So firstly, how do you use a bokashi bin?**

*   A bokashi bin can be located pretty much wherever you like, inside, outside, cold and warm.
*   Set up the bin as instructed by the manufacturer.
*   It's recommended to cut up any food scraps into smaller pieces before putting them into a bokashi bin to aid the composting process.
*   Sprinkle bokashi powder* over the scraps, covering them.
*   Seal the bin firmly.
*   After a while liquid will gather in the bottom chamber, use the tap to collect it, mix with water and use as fertiliser.
*   Occasionally you will need to compact the scraps in your bin, probably causing more liquid to gather in the bottom chamber
*   When the bin is full it's contents can be dug into a garden, either yours, a friend's or a community garden.

**So... Which is best?**  
Well, as in some of the best 'face-offs', both sides have their advantages and disadvantages

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Of course, no "Bokashi vs Worms" article is complete without mentioning that these two methods work amazingly together if you want to do both.  The worms love the Bokashi pre-compost that is produced by the Bokashi process.  Even materials that would otherwise ruin a worm bin (citrus, etc) are easily absorbed by the worms once they have been fully pickeled by the Bokashi.  By using both methods together you get the massive increase in beneficial micro-organisms that are introduced by the Bokashi process and you get it fully soil ready by the worms.</span>
