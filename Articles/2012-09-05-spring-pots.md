If you didn't get a chance to try my <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/07/potted-winter-herbs-other-lazy-tips.html" target="_blank">potted winter herbs & other lazy tips</a> then Spring is a great time to reconnect with the potted joys of renting and gardening.

**Potted seedlings for now**  
As per the Winter potted plan you'll need 2 bags of potting mix, seedlings and your pots or tubs - free if you <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/search/label/reuse" target="_blank">re-use stuff</a> lying around the neighbourhood.

**Spring pots plan**

*   <a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/06/my-secret-love-for-polystyrene.html" target="_blank">Polystyrene box </a>#1 - lettuce, spinach, rocket or all three!
*   Polystyrene box #2 - a climber like cucumber plus dill and beets/carrots/radish
*   Pot #1 (30cm) - <span style="color: #6aa84f;"><a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/01/tip-of-month-january.html" target="_blank">strawberries</a></span><a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/01/tip-of-month-january.html" target="_blank"><b> </b></a>
*   Pot #2 (30cm) - climbing peas with chives (this will create some great soil for your summer tomatoes!)
*   A tiny pot (15cm) - more oregano or sage or mint

**Potted seeds to start now**  
Time to start sowing seeds but keeping them under some shelter to stay warm, under plastic or on a sunny warm window ledge. Seeds to start off now that will grow well in pots later include basil, tomato, leeks,  chilli, capsicum/eggplant (though I think the later are a bit of waste of space if you have limited pots as you don't get many per plant so it's cheaper to buy). I've also started some Okra seeds for something a bit different - have never grown them before so fingers crossed.

**Spring tip**  
During Winter I put all my pots in the most sun exposed nooks I could find. As the sun is slowly heating up I'm regularly checking my pots to see if they need to be moved into a more shady spot or mulched. It's important as Spring is unpredictable. You never know when the sun is going to shine like a superstar and scorch that plant you've nursed all through Winter.
