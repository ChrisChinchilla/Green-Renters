I recently installed a Shower Saver (<a href="http://www.showersaver.com.au" target="_blank">www.showersaver.com.au</a>) after the good people at Green Renters asked me to undertake some independent testing.

Being male, I initially refused to read the installation instructions which meant that the first time I installed it there were a couple of small hiccups.

However, after a quick skim of the instructions on the packet, I installed the device with no fuss at all. All you need is a shifter and some plumbing tape – just make sure that the Shower Saver leaver sits below the showerhead.

The device adds a valve to your showerhead so you can turn the water off mid shower without ever touching the taps.

There’s no denying the effectiveness of it (no water comes out at all) and I’d say it nearly halves your water usage. You get wet, turn the water off, lather up, turn the water on and rinse. Easy.

The water saving are even better when you wash your hair as it is always a longer shower. All in all it’s a highly effective little device that is easy to install and use. I highly recommend it. They are $48 plus postage and handling (Now $78) which seems pretty reasonable given that they are quite sturdy so I imagine they would last a very long time. The real test will be how often I use it on a cold winter’s morning when the shower’s hot water feels like it is the only thing keeping you alive!
