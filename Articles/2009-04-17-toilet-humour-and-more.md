*   Do you go to the toilet? *(hope so!)*
*   Have you been overseas to places without conventional toilets?
*   Do you flush the toilet every time you go?

I was looking into some of these issues and found that there is actually a [World Toilet Organisation][1] (WTO), a global non- profit organization committed to improving toilet and sanitation conditions worldwide. *They actually have an Executive Director job going at the moment which might interest some of you.*

There have already been calls by Australian experts to reduce the amount of water wasted through toilet flushing with a proposed new [toilet tax][2]. Adelaide University's Water Management Professor Mike Young said the tax would encourage people to take shorter showers, recycle washing machine water or connect rainwater tanks to internal plumbing.

> "Some people may go as far as not flushing their toilet as often, as the less sewage you produce the less the rate you pay," Professor Young said.

Like many Australian homes, we have a dual flush system and are in favour of only flushing when needed. The idea of this really hit me when I read an interview of a woman in outback Australia who had to buy water for their farm and they were only able to shower ever second day and flush their loo once a day. It really not necessarily to flush the toilet all the time, it wastes an incredible amount of water.

  I had a bit of a giggle about <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/richard-glover/if-its-yellow-let-it-mellow/2007/02/22/1171733938562.html">this</a> opinion piece. Suddenly not flushing has become to norm, or at least in a house free from visitors...

  Want to make your own toilet cleaner? It doesn't involve a duck or blue liquid but it's  cheap and easy to male.

### DIY toilet cleaner

*   1/2 cup bicarbonate of soda
*   1 cup white vinegar

1.  Mix bicarbonate of soda and vinegar in a spray bottle.
2.  Spray the solution around the toilet bowl and leave for a few minutes then flush.

Use this product safely anywhere in the bathroom for general cleaning.

I also saw [this][3] book which I didn't really have the stomach to flick through, being early morning and all that..
