title: "Could you have a 'spend nothing' Christmas?"

I received an email recently about the [Buy Nothing Christmas][1] campaign. Buy Nothing Christmas is a national initiative started by Canadian Mennonites who offer a prophetic "no" to the patterns of over-consumption of middle-class North Americans. They are inviting Christians (and others) all over Canada to join a movement to de-commercialize Christmas and re-design a Christian lifestyle that is richer in meaning, smaller in impact upon the earth, and greater in giving to people less-privileged.

There is a alternative campaign put into action by [Ad Busters][2] which encourages consumers to use Christmas to reflect on their consumer habits instead of expanding them. I should say first up that as a [small business][3] owner, I have a vested interest in people buying my wares, particularly this time of year! I'll discuss this more in a minute. That said, Christmas (or any occasion) can be festive and celebratory without buying presents.

**Ideas for no spend gift giving**  
**Organise a day trip: ** I still think the most long for gifts for many of us are time and company. I would rather spend a fun day with loved ones rather than get 'more stuff'.  Have a picnic, go swimming, see a film or exhibition, whatever you enjoy.  
**Help a Friend Out:** Help paint the house, plant seedlings in a friend's garden, help them cook for a dinner party. We always appreciate car trips to places we might need to go as we don't drive.<a href="http://www.greenrenters.org/2009/11/could-you-have-a-spend-nothing-christmas/100x100/" rel="attachment wp-att-1313"><img alt="100x100" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1313" src="/sites/default/files/images/100x100.jpg" style="width: 100px; height: 100px; margin: 6px; float: right;" title="100x100" /></a>  
**Recipes:** Most of us have favourite recipes that we are often asked to share. It's  fun gift, especially if you show someone how to prepare the dish. Alternatively you might like to buy a [handmade help cookbook][4] (effectively a donation), with all proceeds going to the Salvation Army towards Victorian bushfire victims.  
**Make something:** Biscuits, jam, home brew, soap, cushions, clothing...the choices are endless. I much prefer baking to going to the department stores at christmas time! If you simply feel you must buy something, consider buying locally produced, handmade products which use recycled materials and support local small businesses. Much better than something made in China that they don't really want. ![][5]
