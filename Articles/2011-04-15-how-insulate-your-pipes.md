Insulating hot water pipes is one of the simplest things a renter can do to make your home more energy efficient, especially in winter, where you could potentially reduce your boiler by 2 degrees.

Pipe insulation can be bought in most hardware stores and it's not particularly expensive, but at Green Renters we're all for the three R's, reduce, reuse and recycle, we had a bunch of old towels lying around so decided to use those!



Now, everyone's boiler is different, so this guide is somewhat general, but should give you a rough idea of what to do. Firstly, if you have any difficulty in locating your boiler, most houses have it outside, whereas most apartments have it on the inside.

Firstly locate your boiler's outlet pipe, hopefully it will be labelled, but if not, gently touch the pipe with the back of your hand to see if it's warm or not. Then follow the outlet pipe to see where else the pipe is currently un-insulated and make a mental note.

Wrap your towel (or of course proper insulation) around the pipe as tightly as possible and tape up any sections that need 'reinforcing', try to cover up as much of the pipe as possible, corners will be fairly hard. As you can see from the images, sometimes pipes can be quite inaccessible and hard to wrap, still, a little insulation is better than none.

And that's pretty much it! Easy eh...
