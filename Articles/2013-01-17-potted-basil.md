Who doesn't love basil? There is nothing like having it fresh and not having to fork out heaps every time you need just a pinch. However many a rented gardener has been disappointed by a dismal basil crop. Why does our beloved basil look fine one day and then the next it withers away? Here are a few tips for growing potted basil:

*   **Remember most basil species are annuals**. That means they aren't going to last forever so focus on 'prolonging' the basil by pruning off any flowers and delay harvesting leaves until the plant is a bit bushy.
*   **Give each plant enough room to 'stretch its legs' when growing basil in pots**. Nothing smaller than 20 cm pot or it will be short lived. If you buy seedlings in a punnet then be sure to separate them out before planting so their roots don't crowd each other. 
*   **Basil needs warm weather to grow so don't be surprised when it dies in winter!** Saying that, make sure bigger leaf basils (sweet basil or purple basil) get constant water and enough shade from harsh afternoon sun  in summer - position your plant for a good dose of morning sun. More heat tolerant basil with smaller leaves (Greek and Thai basil) will thrive in the heat.
*   **If you are growing basil from seed and live in a cool climate, start it off under plastic or on a indoor window ledge from mid spring onwards**. If you live a tropical climate, I'm jealous, and you'll have no worries getting basil going with constant heat and humidity ...just like my mum does with her super luscious tropical basil.
