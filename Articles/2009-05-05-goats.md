I read an interesting article today about Google hiring goats to mow their lawns (more <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/05/mowing-with-goats.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/05/01/google-rents-goats-to-replace-lawnmowers-im-not-kidding/" target="_blank">here</a>) and it reminded me of a post I intended to write some time ago and never got around to it...

If you're lucky enough to have a large lawn, or more likely, an overgrown and abandoned inner-city back yard, you could spend hours and hours hacking at it with yourself, hire someone to do it for you, or let several goats loose and get a few good piles of manure thrown in for good measure. Some time ago, whilst pondering where to start with a massively overgrown backyard in Collingwood I started looking into natures most eager eaters and drew a bit of a blank, not much seems to have changed, a search of "Goat hire Melbourne" returned results about karaoke hire, Mountain Goat beer and some obscure blog posts from an arts project that looked vaguely promising.

*So, do any of you out there know where you can hire Goats from? Either in Melbourne of wherever you happen to live...*
