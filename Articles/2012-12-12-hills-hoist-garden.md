Mini pickling gherkins hanging basket on the Hills Hoist I've found the ultimate vertical garden.

Well actually, it's been in my backyard since I was a kid but I've only just realised its potential. Its theÂ Hills Hoist clothesline.

For my overseas friends, the Hills Hoist clothesline is an Australian icon. A majestic carousel of rusted steel plonked in the centre of the yard. As a kid it was a giant swing, as a teenager it aided our 'goon of fortune'* drinking games and later, with a sheet thrown over it, the Hills Hoist became an instant BBQ marque.

Now it is the perfect frame for climbing beans, peas, mini-gherkins and cucumbers. Not only does it save me space in the rented garden I think it looks delightful (and hides the peeling paint and rust on the clothesline!).
