MONEY - Because so many of these places are classified crime scenes only registered care workers, nurses, police etc are able to get in. So even though clothes etc are a good donation, they don't yet have the resources to transport them there yet. So they need money money money. Donate at any Commonwealth, Westpac, ANZ, National, [Salvation Army][1] or [Red Cross][2]. Salvos and Red Cross are credit card only, all bank branches accept cash.

MOBILE PHONE CHARGERS - people have their phones but no battery life left. There are so many types of phones so many types of chargers are required. If you have any chargers laying around from phones you no longer need, no matter how old or new, please send them to the [Salvation Army][3]

BLOOD - not just this week, but over the next few months. Blood donations have a kind of 'used by date' so while it's good to donate now, it needs to be kept up. Call the Red Cross on 131 495.

LAND - not sure many people have land on which to keep horses, but if you do happen to, call 0411 434123. I don't know who this number belongs to, sorry.

BLANKETING - to keep warm, obviously. Please take them to the [Salvation Army][3]

ANIMAL ACCOMMODATION - if you have room in your house for a dog, cat, rabbit, horse... phone 9739 0300. Some of these will belong to families in emergency care who can't take their pets with them, others belong to families who have passed away. They won't always know which category they belong to so be prepared to foster indefinitely. If you know anyone with animals that are injured by the way, see if you can get them to Lort Smith, they are treating all animals for free.

I'm trying to organise the mobile blood bank to visit the University where I work. We're also organising some fundraisers.

If you'd like to put your craft skills to good use, [The Toy Society ][4]will be collecting handmade toys over the next couple of weeks to be donated to children impacted by the fires. Many families have nothing but the clothes on their backs. Please email <thetoysociety@gmail.com> if you're interested.
