Coping with a scorched garden  
JIM FOGARTY

Gardens have fried this summer but they can be healed, says Jim Fogarty.

The extreme hot weather has played havoc with gardens, leaving them badly burned. Combine this with water restrictions and you can't help but wonder if we are creating a bigger problem for ourselves.

Giving up is an easy answer, but green gardens are the only way we can cool our cities. And contrary to belief, there are several things you can do to help your garden survive the worst of summer.

Gardens with shade are better able to cope with scorching temperatures. Trees are probably the most effective way of creating shade but you might also erect screens and pergolas as a way of introducing it to exposed areas. Temporary shade screens can be installed for days over 36 degrees. Shade cloth is available at garden centres. On the worst days, paving can be covered in hessian or shade cloth to reduce reflective heat.

Mulching

Adding a good layer of mulch is crucial before the heat of summer kicks in, but you can add mulch at any time. Herbaceous leafy plants that are scorched (such as Arthropodium sp., Agapanthus sp. and Iris sp.) can be cut down and the foliage used to mulch bases of trees or larger shrubs. Pruning leafy plants is a good way to help protect them from extreme heat. Woody plants and succulents such as Agave should be left alone, as foliage can take time to grow.

Watering

We are all aware of our mission to reach target 155, but remember, under stage 3a restrictions we can water gardens twice a week at given times. Utilise these times for watering plants that are suffering, but be wise about your usage and only water plants and trees that really need it. If you think a plant is wrong for the position or will not survive, then replace it with a more suitable type. Plants that have best survived our hottest days include roses, ornamental pear trees, proteas, herbs such as rosemary, natives such as grevillea and callistemon, Coastal Rosemary, Salvia, stattice and Smoke Bush (Cotinus sp.).

Repairing

It is easy to despair at the damage caused in extreme heat. The message is to stay positive, as many plants are tougher than we think. Native species are better able to cope with extremely hot weather, and those that don't will drop seed for reproduction at a later date when rain arrives. Deciduous species are also in a good position to cope with extreme heat, just as they do in extreme cold. Leaves will turn to autumn colour and drop, allowing the plant or tree to respond by going into a minor period of dormancy until conditions settle again. Trees and woody shrubs that have been scorched are best left to their own methods of stress response; however, you can pull off dead or dry leaves to improve the look of your garden until new growth begins. If plants have died, then assess suitable replacements but wait until cooler weather before re-planting.

Lawns

Most lawns will bounce back when rain returns. They have the ability to go dormant in times of stress, so have faith - they are stronger than we think. Avoid parking on lawns and causing unnecessary compaction and damage. We should be doing all we can to protect them as they are the best way of cooling our cities. Compacted lawns should be aerated with a mechanical aerator to improve air and water movement down into the soil. There is no need for mowing until they green up again. Keep weeds at bay but, again, don't stress, as things will improve when the weather cools off in autumn.
