We all know that decreasing our car usage is an effective if not always easy step in reducing our carbon footprint. As Australian suburbs gradually become more dense, renters in inner city suburbs may also increasingly find that they have a decreasing amount of space to park and store cars.

However there are still likely to be times when a car is needed for a short or long trip and there have always been some options available such as

*   **Borrowing a friends car** : usually a cheap option, but relies on a fair amount of trust between parties.
*   **Traditional car hire** : These can be inconvenient and expensive.

Almost ideally suited to inner city living, a new breed of car hire companies have started popping up in Melbourne and Sydney with more accessible locations, pay as you go hire fees and heaps less paperwork, bureaucracy and inconvenience. There are several main companies we are currently aware of that function in similar ways.

*   <a href="http://www.greensharecar.com.au" target="_blank">Green Share Car</a>
*   <a href="http://www.goget.com.au/" target="_blank">Go Get</a>

We don't drive, so have no opinions or experiences of these services, do you?
