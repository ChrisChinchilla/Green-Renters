  Many of us find ourselves throwing away uneaten food.This workshop looked at portion sizes, ways of storing food and how to make the most of your fridge, freezer and pantry. If<br />like many people you are confused by “best before, use by, display until and sell by” dates then the workshops helps explain the difference, as well as giving partipants the opportunity to discuss ways to use leftovers and share recipes.
