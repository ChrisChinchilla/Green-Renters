Ok, we admit, the classifieds section we started testing wasn't all that good... Then we came across <a href="http://www.greenrenter.com" target="_blank">www.greenrenter.com</a> that is precisely what you've been asking for, listings for environmentally minded tenants and landlords looking for each other, and unlike Green Renters, it's dedicated to the task.

It's mainly US focused, but has International listings and after we had a little chat to them, they've tweaked the address settings slightly to make allowances for Australian listings and are open to listings from other countries if the demand is there.

So start adding your listings and lets help a site with a great idea grow!
