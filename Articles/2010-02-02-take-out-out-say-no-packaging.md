I was really excited to find out about the new [Take Out With Out ][1]Campaign, directed at reducing the use of unnecessary plastics and packaging with take out food. They have the very sensible creed:

**Refuse Unnecessary Stuff**  
When taking out, refuse the unnecessary packaging! Think about the spoons, forks, straws, and napkins that you get served (why do they give you enough for a family of 20 when eating alone?). Ask yourself before accepting all these items, "Do I really need all of this?", "Am I going to be eating this right away?" (If so, why take the bag or the napkins)... just enjoy your muffin - and be neat so the napkin isn't needed or share your crumbs with the insects.

**RetakeYour Own Reusables**  
Bring your own reusables (BYOR) and you won't need to use the can - garbage, that is. You can bring your own containers, straws, cutlery, mugs, bottles, and even your own bag - It's so easy to find and use!

**ReconsiderYour Habits**  
It's easy to fall into a routine, so why not choose to create a new one? Reconsider and readjust your habits and adopt healthier eating strategies - it might be challenging at first - but it will save you time, money, your health, and our world. The bonus? You'll feel like an eco-hero and will inspire others around you to follow suit.

It's a great little campaign which includes posters and wallet sized tips you can download, an interesting blog and a list of restaurants which support the cause. I usually bring my own bags where I go, and still often have to state more than once "I don't need a bag thanks", and I think this is a great extension of the BYO bag idea, taking it up a notch. We've seen it happen with the reusable coffee cups such as the [Keep Cups ][2]we reviewed last last year and I think this is the next step. It would be great if restaurants and cafes supported the enterprise by offering a small discount to those who BYO their own containers etc since they are saving on packaging.
