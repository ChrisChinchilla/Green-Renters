Buy Nothing Day is your special day to unshop, unspend and unwind. Relax and do nothing for the economy and for yourself - at least for a single day.

Everything we buy has an impact on the environment, Buy Nothing Day highlights the environmental and ethical consequences of consumerism. The developed countries - only 20% of the world population are consuming over 80% of the earth's natural resources, causing a disproportionate level of environmental damage, and an unfair distribution of wealth.

As consumers we need to question the products we buy and challenge the companies who produce them. What are the true risks to the environment and developing countries? We all know recycling is OK for the the environment, but consuming less is better and Buy Nothing Day is a great way to start. Free things to do instead of Spending:

*   Spend time with family or friends
*   Bake a cake
*   Go on a picnic
*   Play board games or cards
*   Go for a walk on the beach
*   Visit a gallery, museum or open air concert
*   Write a letter
*   Call a friend
*   Watch a DVD
*   Visit your local library for free books, dvds, magazines and cds
*   Sleep
