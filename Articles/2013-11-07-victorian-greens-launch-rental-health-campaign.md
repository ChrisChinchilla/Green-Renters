One of our policies stances for some time has been regarding minimum standards for rental properties in Australia and we are now one step closer with the Greens in Victoria announcing a policy platform in the state parliament.

Read the <a href="http://vicmps.greens.org.au/rental-health-FAQ" target="_blank">FAQ about the announcement and policy</a>Â and <a href="http://vicmps.greens.org.au/content/rental-health" target="_blank">Greg Barber announcing the bill</a>.

Alongside the policy announcement is a campaign to encourage tenants to 'dob in a dive', we're not entirely sure what will be done with submissions, but I guess at least it's fuel for gaining some support (or proof) for the campaign.
