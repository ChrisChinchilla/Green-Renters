Happy new year to all! For the first post of the year I'm sharing a potted plant idea that is easy to make, practical,  healthy, saves you money and I think looks lovely. It is a pyrethrum planter.

A pyrethrum planter is a large dish shaped container potted up with a pyrethrum plant to ward of insects and companion planted with herbs. As it is in a pot you can move the pyrethrum around your place or from rental to rental. It is great for having at your feet when outside having a BBQ or placed on the window in an apartment. Pyretherum is a perennial plant which means if you take good care of it you'll have it for a few years and the dried flowers provide  is a natural insect repellent.

This little potted idea came to me when I found a discarded pot in an attractive saucer shape; large surface area but relatively little depth to the pot. Such a pot always looks snazzy and usually you would find it sitting in a water feature. As I don't have a luxurious fountain piece in my rented garden (who does?), I was at a loss as how to use the pot. The pot was more suited to shallow rooted herbs but with summer approaching, and a dislike for yucky chemical insect repellents, the pyrethrum planter was born.

**You will need**

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Dish shaped pot - salvage or buy a large  pot. Mine is approximately 35 cm in diameter and about 10 cm deep. Most people make the mistake of over planting these pots and the plants die. Upside means you can often buy these discarded pots from second hand shops or find in hard rubbish.
  </li>
  <li>
    Potting mix (organic if possible) - enough to fill the pot. 
  </li>
  <li>
    Pyrethrum seeds or one seedling (tanacetum cinerariifolium). You'll find the seedlings for pyrethrum in the herb section of a nursery.
  </li>
  <li>
    Companion herbs - seeds, seedlings or cuttings of something low growing and shallow rooted. I've used thyme but perhaps you could also use tarragon or parsley. I'd avoid water loving and nutrient sucking plants like mint, dill or coriander.
  </li>
</ul>

**Step by step**

1.  Make sure there are holes for drainage in the bottom of the pot and then fill with a layer of course bits and pieces. I use pebbles, sticks and stones I find around the place. Aim for no more than a 2 cm high layer of drainage materials as you don't want to compromise on the already shallow growing space for the plant roots.
2.  Fill with potting mix leaving a hole in the centre for the pyrethrum seedling or seeds. Water the potting mix then add the seedling or seeds. Make sure that you don't compact the potting mix too much when you firm down the seedling or seeds. Water in the pyrethrum seedling or seeds.
3.  Plant your seedlings/ cutting of herbs or seeds around the circumference of the pot - just around the edge - but making sure there is enough room for the herbs to stretch their legs. Water in the herbs.

**Care**  
I would avoid the hard afternoon sun in summer so the pot doesn't dry out (a risk due its large surface area). Keep in part-shade during summer i.e. morning sun.  By trial and error I've discovered that my pyrethrum planter doesn't like a very open windy spot so recommend you find somewhere that is a little protected to ensure the flowers blossom. And they will go crazy in no time. Beautiful daisy flowers!Water regularly but make sure the pot drains well especially if you companion plant with thyme. In winter, move to a full sun position but protect from frost if you live somewhere really cold.
