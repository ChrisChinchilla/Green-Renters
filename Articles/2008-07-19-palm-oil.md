A slightly difficult and mysterious issue to fully expand and explain, but the mass production of Palm Oil causes untold havoc all around the world, form the leveling of rain forests, the suppression of local farmers by multinationals, the killing of wildlife and much more...

Added to that, it's not a legal requirement in Australia to state whether Palm oil is included in food products and is normally listed as 'Vegetable Oil'. Issues like this affect all of us, as it's quite easy to do something about them, boycotting <span class="blsp-spelling-corrected" id="SPELLING_ERROR_5">certain</span> foods and letter writing to members of parliament and food companies all help...

So, get going renters everywhere!

There are a lot of resources out there, but here's a good Australian one.
