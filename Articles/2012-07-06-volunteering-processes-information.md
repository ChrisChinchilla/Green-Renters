**So, you're interested in volunteering with us or are already volunteering with us?**

This page will talk through some of the ethos and technicalities of how and why we run our operations, it will hopefully be clear and understandable, no matter your level of experience, but if it isn't, [then please contact us][1].

**We are a small, lean and modern organisation**

We don't have a formal office, we don't have a large staff and we all work in different locations at different times of the day, this is why we value volunteers, but also why we strongly subscribe to several more modern ways of working that draw on the experience of working in the software development sector possessed by some of our staff. Thus…

*   You are always more than welcome to come into our home office 'HQ' in Brunswick, Victoria, but you don't need to, you can work with us whenever and wherever you like, we have the systems and processes in place for you to take advantage of.
*   We use several online systems for managing our projects, contacts, documents and content. You will be provided with access details for those as and when required. Documentation for all of them is following, but please take time to get to know them, they will help you and us. If you have problems with any of them, [please let us know][1].
*   We have a large backlog of tasks, projects and ideas looking for someone to run with as well as items that require immediate attention. It's very much up to you if you want to jump into our backlog every now and then and grab a task you're interested in or if you want to work on a project (of your or our making) over a longer period of time.
*   We would appreciate it if you could tell us how long it takes for you to complete tasks. This is by no means a way of 'keeping tabs' on you, but just so we know how long particular tasks take if a project you're working on ever becomes funded and we can budget accordingly.
*   We're into collaboration and passing tasks around. If you're working on something you need help with or want to pass to someone else, go ahead!

**So, what do we use for what?**

*Drupal & CiviCRM*  
This is where you are now, <a href="http://drupal.org" target="_blank">Drupal</a> runs our website, the content, articles, our store and a few other bits and pieces, if you are interested in writing for us, you will spend a lot of time getting to know Drupal. <a href="http://civicrm.org" target="_blank">CiviCRM</a> is how we handle our memberships, mailing lists, donations, events and general contact management, if you're interested in helping us with data entry, newsletters or events, you will be using CiviCRM.

Drupal and CiviCRM work together and you will use the same login for them, to create an account for yourself [visit the following page][2], if you have already expressed an interest in becoming a volunteer with us and use the same email address you contacted us with when you register, you will automatically be set up as a volunteer on the website and have access to the areas you will need.

*Redmine*  
Our projects and associated tasks that need to be undertaken are found in <a href="http://redmine.org" target="_blank">Redmine</a>, you will (currently) need a separate login for this and if you have already expressed an interest in volunteering with us, you should have received some login details. If you haven't, [please contact us][1]. Redmine is likely to be your main source of information for what's going on and what you can get involved with.

Further information on [how we use Redmine can be found here][5].

*Dropbox*  
For sharing files, images and resources we use the popular cloud based service, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>. if you require access to anything in the Green Renters Dropbox, we will share individual folders with you. You may need to setup your own Dropbox account, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/register" target="_blank">which can be done here</a>.
