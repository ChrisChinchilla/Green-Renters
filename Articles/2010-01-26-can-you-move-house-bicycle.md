Russell Jarvis (pictured) hits the road, moving house by bike.

MOVING house by bicycle might take a little longer than using a man with a van but it’s a lot more fun, says Preston resident Jos Tait. Ms Tait is a member of the Transition Darebin group, formed late last year as part of the global Transition Towns movement, which prepares the community for peak oil and climate change through practical, low energy alternatives. The group is offering a Darebin Bike Move service for those game enough to try. “We’ve already shown it can be done, we (about a dozen cyclists) moved Russell Jarvis from East Brunswick to Heidelberg.” She said the 15km trip took a few hours via the scenic route through Darebin along the Merri Creek. Riding a recumbent bicycle with a trailer, Mr Jarvis led the two wheeled movers to his new address.

“For anyone interested in shifting house by bike, we need to know when they’re moving and what they’re moving and then we’ll drum up some movers and get some bike trailers,” Ms Tait said.

Human Powered Cycles and Loophole in Thornbury loaned the group bike trailers for Mr Jarvis’ move. For more information about Bike Move or Transition Darebin email<transitiondarebin@gmail.com>

IF you can't quite get your head around how this would be possible, here's one example
