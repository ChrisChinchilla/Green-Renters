Here's our bumper list of some of our most favourite tutorials sourced from the never ending resource that is the Internet. Making gifts is a great way to avoid shopping centres, especially if you utilise materials you already have. It also means that your gift is local, thoughtful and ethically produced. There's also no cheap plastic involved!Â  I'd also much prefer a couple of hours in the kitchen to a day at the shops! Present your gift in reusable containers, jars and the like to keep in with the environmentally friendly ethos.
