Green Planet has published an article today on the[ best edible plants for container gardens][1]. What are your favourites or successes? I find mine depend on the amount of watering, the heat and whether they are visited by neighbourhood cats! Cate's successes:

*   Parsley
*   Pansies
*   Baby Tomatoes
*   Chillies
*   Chives
*   Mint
*   Lettuces

Cate's dismal failures:

*   Lavender
*   Rosemary
*   Basil

(I have had a bit more success planting these directly into garden beds however)
