So to ween myself of the laptop and get back into the garden I thought food and gardening apps might be the way to go. I found a few gems which are listed below. These are useful and low cost and you can tell are designed my food growing obsessed people!

Apart from these there was a lot of crap out there  - not even worth the download time let alone the subscription fee. There is a real need for some bright spark to create a good garden app for urban food growers... it got me wondering can gardening and IT programing skills ever co-habit in one person???

**My top 3 apps**  
 

**<a href="http://www.gardenate.com/iphone" target="_blank">Gardenate</a>**  
The tried and tested Gardenate website is now available as an app. This fully portable version of Gardenate with extra features like your own planting and harvest calendar localized to your climate zone. It lists the best choices for planting right now and advice on getting the best from each crop.  
Costs about $2.

<a href="http://leafsnap.com/" target="_blank"><b>Leafsnap</b></a>  
WOW! Leafsnap is the first in a series of electronic field guides being developed by researchers from Columbia University, the University of Maryland and the Smithsonian Institution. This app uses super technology I don’t understand  to help identify tree species from photographs of their leaves. It has pretty pics of leaves, flowers, fruit, petiole, seeds, and bark.  Currently just has species found in the USA.  
Free to use

**<a href="http://dibble.com.au/" target="_blank">Dibble</a>**  
Finding locally grown, produced and sold food just got a whole lot easier. According to the developers  'Dibble' is an old gardening/agricultural tool originating from Roman times, that was used to create holes in the ground for sowing seeds. This is definitely a food grower friendly site. It connects local food growers and buyers listing places to sell and buy local produce. Just in Australia at this stage.  
Costs to list as a seller, free for users and buyers.
