Inspired by the efforts of Chris over the weekend I found a few more tidbits...

*   Light installation from <a class="snap_shots" href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/07/recycling_milk.php">Treehugger</a>
*   Milkcrate furniture from <a class="snap_shots" href="http://milkcratedigest.com/">this</a> site
*   Crate bookshleves from <a class="snap_shots" href="http://flickr.com/photos/daddytypes/2154983078/">Flickr</a> : (The description is worth a read as the author is desperate to state their fashionableness hehe)
*   How cool are <a class="snap_shots" href="http://www.landliving.com/categories/Personal.aspx">these</a> crate briefcases!
*   And you can find milk crate art <a class="snap_shots" href="http://images.google.com.au/imgres?imgurl=http://bp2.blogger.com/_NpINLHeo8rM/R-pfGAl6p7I/AAAAAAAARs8/2_db3G63Quc/s400/1.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.crookedbrains.net/2008/03/how-creative-can-you-get-with-crates.html&h=350&w=400&sz=35&hl=en&start=37&um=1&usg=__C0MPzzObC2HDgtBpGqOTI2-jbkI=&tbnid=O9-16V1tTH-eJM:&tbnh=109&tbnw=124&prev=/images%3Fq%3Dmilk%2Bcrate%2Bfurniture%26start%3D20%26ndsp%3D20%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26client%3Dfirefox-a%26rls%3Dorg.mozilla:en-GB:official%26sa%3DN">here</a> including our very own Milk Crate Man!
