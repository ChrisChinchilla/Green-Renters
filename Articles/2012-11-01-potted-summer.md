First day of summer!

I’ve swapped the garden boots for flip flops and my goal this summer is to avoid those distinctive gardener come test match cricketer tan marks - the sunnies mark around the eyes! However if you are an apartment or small space gardener you won’t have to worry about gardening tan lines too much and can focus on the many joyous and delicious treasures to grow in pots over summer.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">No matter how small your space, we are spoilt for choice by what we can grow in summer pots.  Imagine enjoying your own ruby red tomatoes with friends at summer BBQs or having your own supply of fresh lettuce leaves. Yumbo! Here is my plan for a potted summer: </span><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2oLBFhWrJXg/UJHAVl6H_-I/AAAAAAAAAr0/0pIsY9qT1Uk/s1600/IMAG0472.jpg" style="line-height: 1.5;"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-2oLBFhWrJXg/UJHAVl6H_-I/AAAAAAAAAr0/0pIsY9qT1Uk/s200/IMAG0472.jpg" style="border-width: 0px; border-style: solid; width: 150px; height: 200px; margin: 8px; float: left;" /></a>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Potted summer - milk crate vegetables </span><b style="line-height: 1.5;">Potted seedlings</b><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> Like the Winter & Spring potted plans you'll need 2 bags of potting mix/compost, seedlings and your pots or tubs:  </span>

<ul style="text-align: left;">
  <li>
    Polystyrene box #1:4 tomatoes & 1 punnet of basil
  </li>
  <li>
    Polystyrene box #2: Summer salad leaves (I love lamb’s leaves, tatsoi, cos) & carrots. Plant in alternate rows
  </li>
  <li>
    Milk crate #1: 3 zucchinis (at corners so they trail over the edges) & 1 companion flower i.e. geranium cutting
  </li>
  <li>
    Milk crate #2:1 chili & 2 sunflowers
  </li>
  <li>
    Pot #1 (30cm):strawberries
  </li>
  <li>
    Pot #2 (30cm):1 capsicum or eggplant
  </li>
  <li>
    A tiny pot (15cm):mint or thyme cutting
  </li>
</ul>

**Potted seeds**  
Time to start sowing seeds but keeping them under some shelter to stay at a constant temperature. Seeds to start off now that will grow well in pots later include kale, cress, rocket, watermelon, pumpkin and second crops of lettuce and basil.

**Summer tips**  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Herbs need hardly any room and do great on a windowsill in summer. When you are short on space remember that your greens like lettuce and spinach don’t need as much sun as the fruiting plants. In summer mulch your pots like crazy to keep consistent temperatures, water early in the morning, harvest herbs continually to keep plants productive.</span>
