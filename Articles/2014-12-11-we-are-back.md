Green Renters has finally begun the process of '<a href="https://okfn.org/opendata/" target="_blank">opening</a>' the organisation.

We mentioned this as our new direction and strategy in mid-2014 and now after several months of working through all the information and resources acquired over 7 years of existence, our workshops (one of our most successful activities) are online.

We are undertaking this project with a small budget and thus very little time, hence we have focussed on trying to get our content organised and not the look and feel of the website. It will be basic and missing functionality, maybe for a short while, maybe indefinitely. We will slowly be adding more and more over the coming months and improving what we have. If you are keen to help the process along, please [become a member][1] or volunteer your time to the project.
