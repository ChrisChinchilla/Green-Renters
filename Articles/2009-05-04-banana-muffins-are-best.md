  We're having people over for lunch today so I have been baking some root vegetables. When I use the oven I always try to cook a few things at once to maximise the gas usage. So I decided to make these for breakfast/morning tea muffins. <p>
    Â

  <p>
    <strong>Ingredients</strong>:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      2 cups Chris' muesli*
    </li>
    <li>
      1/2 cup rolled oats
    </li>
    <li>
      1 cup flour
    </li>
    <li>
      2 mashed bananas (from the freezer)
    </li>
    <li>
      1 whisked egg
    </li>
    <li>
      nutmeg
    </li>
    <li>
      milk
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    Mix ingredients together and bake for about 20 mins, Serve with yummy home made jam!

    *Chris makes his own muesli. It's extremely cost effective (about $6 for a big nine liter container full) and it gives you a lot of control of what ingredients you choose. Chris' muesli typically includes rolled oats, bran, wheat germ, dates, sultanas, cashews and almonds. He buys all the ingredients in bulk at a local wholesaler.

    We freeze bananas when they are cheap for smoothies and muffins.
