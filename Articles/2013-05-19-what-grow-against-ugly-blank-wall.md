    Well the neighbour's horrifically excessive renovation is progressing along and we now have a brand new 10 foot grey rendered cement wall forming part of our rented backyard. Times like this I'm quite glad I rent as hopefully I won't have to look at it too much longer.

    Nonetheless, I can't escape the wall for a few months more so time to think about how to make it easier on the eye. <br /><a name='more'></a>Channelling my Zen gardener I try to see the big ugly wall as a big blank canvas. Did I mention it's north facing so will retain heat. Bingo - perfect spot for the greenhouse to keep my little <b><a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/07/potted-winter-herbs-other-lazy-tips.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #38761d;">winter seedlings</span></a> </b>cosy and help prolong my annual herbs. That height will come in handy so I'm thinking vertical gardening. The soil has been compacted from the builders so it'll be pots of edible climbers. Perhaps passionfruit or maybe I'll give sweet potato a go for the first time.

    There is so much of that big bland wall to cover so why stop there. The perfect thing to add to complete the greening of the wall could be <b><a href="http://www.therentedspade.com/2012/07/moss-painting.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #38761d;">moss painting</span></a><span style="color: #38761d;">.</span><span style="color: #38761d;"> </span></b>I just have to decide on what design to create. Or maybe I'll just cover the whole big bland thing in moss.
