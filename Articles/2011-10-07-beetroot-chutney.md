For this chutney you cook the first step is beetroot whole with the skin on. This keeps in more of the flavour and nutrients of the beetroot than if you were to peel it first then cook it. Peeling cooked beetroot can be messy so you might like to wear plastic gloves when doing this. You can play around with the spices to change the flavour to one that suites your taste. This sweet and spicy chutney is great in sandwiches, served with cheese or as an accompaniment to curries.

*   1 kg of beetroot
*   2 medium apples, diced
*   2 large onions, diced
*   1 1/2 cups sugar
*   2 cups white or cider vinegar
*   2 teaspoon grated fresh ginger
*   1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
*   1 teaspoon ground cardamon
*   1 teaspoon ground pepper
*   1 teaspoon ground cloves
*   1 teaspoon salt

Cook whole beetroot in boiling water until tender. Allow to cool then peel and dice.

Place apples, onion, sugar, vinegar and spices in a heavy based pot.. Stir while bringing to the boil to ensure that the sugar is dissolved. Add the beetroot and lower to a simmer. Cook for 45 minutes, or until thick and reduced, stirring from time to time.

Pour into sterilised jars, label and store in a cool, dark place for up to a year. Refrigerate chutney once opened.
