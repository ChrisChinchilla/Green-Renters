There's been a lot of talk floating around the interweb over the past few months about solar ovens, with several designs winning international design awards. Casting the larger projects aside, it's surprisingly easy to make your own. I came across this great <a href="http://www.thedailygreen.com/green-homes/blogs/diy-hacks/diy-solar-oven-460611" target="_blank">link</a> on the daily green showing you how to make your own solar oven from a left over cardboard box. We'll try one at Green Renters towers soon. In related links, <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5256514/top-10-cheap-but-great-cardboard-creations" target="_blank">lifehacker</a> has a great (and half jovial, half serious) article on ten other items you can make with cardboard boxes. There are some inspiring ideas.
