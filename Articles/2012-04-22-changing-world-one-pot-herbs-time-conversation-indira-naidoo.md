Last week I talked to Indira Naidoo – who you will remember from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrpQ2hus48A&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">SBS</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXfNovgbf9A&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">ABC Late News</a>, and who you also might know from her publicity blitz for her best-selling new book, <a href="http://www.penguin.com.au/products/9781921382536/edible-balcony" target="_blank">The Edible Balcony</a>. Indira is a natural born communicator – she studied Journalism, had a successful TV Journalism career, and now runs a Sustainability Communications business with her husband, Mark FitzGerald. Not to mention the bit about being <a href="http://saucyonion.blogspot.com.au/2012/02/edible-balcony-bestseller.html" target="_blank">a Top Ten published author</a>. Indira and Mark travel a LOT, and have fingers in a multitude of exciting and delicious pies, so <a href="http://saucyonion.blogspot.com.au/" target="_blank">her blog</a> is basically a whole lot of images and text from the perfect life.

So how did she get from the Late News to writing a book about growing your own food on an ordinary-sized balcony? Two words: Climate Change.

In 2009, Al Gore, the man behind <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnjx6KETmi4&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, selected and trained 261 Australians to be Climate Ambassadors – to go out into the community and raise awareness about Climate Change, and how to ameliorate it. Indira was one of the 261, and she says this is where her latest communications venture really began. 2009 was a pretty depressing year: Kevin Rudd backed away from the ETS, Malcolm Turnbull got rolled as leader of the Libs, and <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/dec/19/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-obama" target="_blank">the Copenhagen Summit</a> failed to produce any worthwhile international advances on managing Climate Change. So, after training with the man who ‘used to be the next president of the USA’, Indira was across the issues intellectually, and she was becoming aware of the ‘jumps she had to connect’ – 70% of the people in the City of Sydney are apartment dwellers; more and more people are concerned with food provenance, and the idea of organic and home grown food; there is widespread anxiety and fear about Climate Change, and people are feeling powerless, as individuals, to make change.

“I was seeing how polarising the issue was becoming then, and obviously it is very polarising now, but then it was quite terrifying just how quickly it had leapt into this area of absolute madness,” she says, “and I realised the messages were just not getting through. (But) I’ve often found that food is a great icebreaker – when you start talking about food and sharing food you can have such divergent views on everything and you can at least find a way to connect. So I knew I needed to find a way to make change from a food point of view.”

Her epiphany was at a farmers market, when she tasted a stall-holder’s incredibly tasty heirloom tomatoes. She realised she wasn’t going to find tomatoes like that at her local Woolworths, but that she could easily grow them herself. “I said to the guy that I’d love to try and grow some of those from seed, and (then) I thought, THIS could be a good way (to communicate about Climate Change). People love those stories: don’t just tell me what I should do, show me. This was going to be good for me too, to physically have to do it. So it was like a personal journey.”

That personal journey involved boring practicalities, like finding out how much weight her balcony could bear, negotiating with her neighbours about watering run-off, and creating cunning modifications to planter boxes, so they could be wheeled in out of the slamming Sydney rain, for example; and a lot of exciting exploration of precedents, like Signature Apartments in Sydney, part of the <a href="http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/environment/GreenVillages/GreenApartments.asp" target="_blank">City Of Sydney’s Smart Green Apartments program</a>; <a href="http://rooftopfarms.org/about/" target="_blank">Eagle Street Farms in Brooklyn</a>; <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hy0O8JqOECo&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">Alice Waters’ Edible Schools program in San Francisco</a>; and time spent in the city of Berlin, “one of the most exciting cities when it comes to sustainability building.” At the end of this stage of her personal journey, there was The Edible Balcony, released through Penguin last year. The Edible Balcony is a cooking/gardening/self-help/memoir hybrid, and has 60 recipes (I’ve tried 3 of them – all excellent, especially the Potato and Pea Samosas. Yum.) And it is a look at a year in the life of her balcony, with tips on what to plant for which season, and ideas for successful small space/container planting – balcony or backyard. The book is clever, accessible, colourful and interesting, and it has obviously spoken to a very deep need in the reading public, as it has been an enormous success. So much so that Indira is now in talks with several TV Production companies about how to bring the book into a television format, “how to do that, and how to do that right, because obviously that reaches an even bigger audience.”

This is all part of Indira’s mission: to empower as wide an audience as possible to take small, personal steps to ameliorate Climate Change, one pot of herbs at a time.

“(In the beginning) I was thinking about different ways I could talk about issues in a way that people wouldn’t realise that that was what I was talking about, and in a way it was a dastardly plan.... (because) a lot of people felt the solutions to Climate Change were these huge, political structures and carbon pricing and what role can I play in any of this? What can I do? Me, one individual person? (Growing) a pot of herbs in itself isn’t going to make a huge difference, but it’s changing our attitude. I feel that once you get people thinking about the plants, thinking about the foods they eat, thinking about environment, thinking about the weather, then you’re thinking about these things in different ways... And (you’re) starting to look at the role human beings play on the planet.
