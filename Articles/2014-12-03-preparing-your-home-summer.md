In this workshop, we explored practical strategies and ideas to create temporary/semi-permanent solutions to keep a rental home cooler through the hot summer with the aim to reduce the heat of summer in a house or apartment.

This workshop included:

*   Installing low cost internal and/or external shading for your rental home
*   DIY fly screens and insulation
*   Green shading and temperate planting
*   Cooling recipes for tasty beverages and ice blocks (with tastings included!)
