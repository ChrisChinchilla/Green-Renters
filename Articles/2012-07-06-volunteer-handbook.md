**Sexual harassment bullying discrimination policy**

At Green Renters we endeavour to provide a space where shared goals for the betterment of the environment and renters alike mean that. A diverse range of people with a wide range of backgrounds, origins, cultures and experiences can come together. Renters by nature are a diverse group and thus green renters volunteers are thus diverse in their backgrounds and experiences.

Green renters strives to comply with both federal and state legislation with regard to ensuring Green Renters workspaces for all volunteers are free of discrimination, sexual harassment and bullying.

Green Renters will not condone any acts of any kind that are of a discriminatory or harassing nature.

Volunteers will not be discriminated against nor should they discriminate against an individual on the basis of their gender, age, marital status, religion, or beliefs, race, pregnancy, disability or political opinions. The process of volunteer recruitment at Green Renters accords to the principles of equal opportunity and volunteers will be matched according to skills and service needs.
