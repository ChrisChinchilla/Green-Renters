A quiet but good start to our pilot International student challenge with students from Brazil, Poland, Iran, Malaysia, India and err, Ballarat.

The main focus for the evening was waste and after a delicious pasta meal kindly provided by the Couch, we all settled down to hear from the City of Melbourne's Waste Officer, Melanie. Whilst it seemed that a lot of attendees didn't actually live in the city a lot of what she covered was relevant to everyone and it seemed that Waste Officers around the city are doing a great job as everyone was pretty clued up already! It was fascinating to hear what happens to waste in countries around the world from small entreprenureal businesses built around processing it to it all just being thrown into one bag to never be seen again.

Next up was Ben from Zoos Victoria, as well as running three great visitor attractions in the City, Healseville and Werribee, the Zoo also runs programs on animal advocacy and in particular, waste. The Zoo's *'They're calling on you'* program recycles mobile phones, preserving the valuable coltan found in them, preventing damage to the natural habitats of Gorillas and creating work for inhabitants of the Democratic Republic of the Congo where a lot of the coltan comes from. Ben also talked about toilet paper and the crazyness that is people using virgin (from new trees) paper for such a task. Not only are we destroying trees, but again, the natural habitat of lots of wildlife.

Finaly Kylie from Computerbank talked about her organisation's work. Computerbank recycles donated computers and distributes them to disadvantaged individuals and community groups. Donated computers are tested, hard drives wiped, virus free open source software is installed on the computers and obsolete parts are recycled. The recycled working computers come complete with a keyboard, monitor/screen and mouse and training booklet. They also offer free training with each computer. This work is carried out by volunteers and staff.
