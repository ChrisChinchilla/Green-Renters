**Project 1. Reduce drafts in your house**  
While a cool breeze is lovely in summer, i's more common to notice the hot wind blow under the door or rattling the windows. It's unpleasant, and if you choose to use cooling, it reduces its efficiency  
Further, in winter, draughts can account for up to 25% of heat losses. Reducing these draughts can be a cheap and cost effective way of reducing heating and cooling costs.  
Draughts can be further reduced by:

*   Draught proofing doors and windows
*   Sealing up cracks and gaps
*   Sealing unnecessary vents
*   Sealing exhaust fans and outlet grills
*   Sealing unused fireplaces

One easy transportable method to reduce door draughts is to [make your own][2] door snakes (or dogs as the tutorial linked provides!).  
For the sides of doors and windows adhesive backed foam is a good resource Hardware stores sell it in various widths and thicknesses, and the tape is self-adhesive and easy to install. Simply cut the tape to the length you need with scissors, peel away the backing from the tape and stick it in place. The size and flexibility of tape make it well suited for blocking irregular-sized cracks.
