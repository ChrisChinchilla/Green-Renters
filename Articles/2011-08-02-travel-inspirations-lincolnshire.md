It's amazing what you can find in the country with a little digging…

We've been quite busy tucked away in this little corner on the English countryside known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horncastle,_Lincolnshire" target="_blank">Horncastle</a>, which has a surprising amount of notable past residents, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Banks" target="_blank">Joseph Banks</a>, for all our Australian and scientific readers.

**Music and Trivia**  
For it's size, Horncastle has a surprisingly good social scene and so far we've made it to an open Mic night at the infamous <a href="http://www.oldnickstavern.co.uk/" target="_blank">Old Nics</a> (run by a couple who have also run pubs and musical venues in Melbourne for another twist of coincidence) where my Dad made a typical embarrassment of himself and I jumped up on the drums for a blues jam and proceeded to play them badly. We also made it to a pub quiz, in which (typically) we didn't know the answers to many questions, made up stupid answers and came last. Whilst these sorts of activities in larger cities and towns are a great place for new arrivals to meet and get to know people, so far we've found that in a small town they are the haunt of staunch regulars who almost look upon newbies as a worrying threat, still it beats watching TV.

  <strong>Beer and food</strong><br />I have been making the most of the good exchange rate (for the $AU) and enjoying many pints of good old fashioned, locally brewed real ale. So far I have enjoyed <a href="http://www.springhead.co.uk/the-leveller" target="_blank">The Leveller</a>, <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/idle-dog/96833/" target="_blank">Idle dog</a>, <a href="http://www.beermad.org.uk/cgi-bin/show_brewery_info.cgi?cookie=refresh&id=4249" target="_blank">Idle Landlord</a> and more that I've forgotten about :-/ It's great to see the real ale and micro-brewery industry in the UK experiencing a renaissance much like back in Australia, if you're interested in knowing more, make sure you take a look at the work of <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/" target="_blank">CAMRA</a> (Campaign for real ale). Food has been as average as always in the UK, it varies greatly depending where you go and what you're willing to pay. We've had a very average roast, an awesome picnic, some delicious cakes and a few homemade treats along the way. Being in the country we've sampled some great homegrown tomatoes, heirloom beetroots (including white, yellow and orange ones), onions and rhubarb as well as lovely locally produced cheese. Four chickens have been producing bright yellow daily eggs to boot.

  Packaging is perhaps one of the biggest problems with food.
</p>

Upon receiving a sit down meal, condiments are served in throw away sachets rather than in a bottle or container which can be refilled. We had a look for some bananas, and oddly the 'fair trade' bananas came wrapped in plastic.

  This also extends to drinks. A lot of mixers don't come on tap as in Melbourne. For example, when ordering a gin and tonic the tonic comes in a small can or bottle, which is poured into your glass and then discarded. Small bottles of wine can be purchased from the pub, which are served with a glass instead of from a bottle. This is of course means lots of unnecessary packaging!

**Alternative community**  
I'll admit we didn't spend much time looking into any kind of political or sustainability type groups or events round Horncastle, but we quickly and easily found a fair bit in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lincoln,_England" target="_blank">Lincoln</a>, which is a relatively burgeoning <a href="http://www.lincoln.ac.uk/home/" target="_blank">University</a> town and has a fair history behind it (nearly 2,000 years). Firstly we were lucky enough to be in town on Critical mass Friday, it was a small but dedicated turn out, but not having any bikes with us, we sent them on their merry way without us. Sunday was when we really had a good dig beneath the cobbled surface at a skills sharing day organised by the <a href="http://lincolnundergroundcollective.wordpress.com" target="_blank">LUC</a> (Lincoln Underground Collective). For a new group, organising a debut event, who only started organising it two months ago, it was a fantastic event, with a great turnout where we learnt a lot about activism in the UK and others learnt a lot about activism in Australia. Some of the groups worth noting are:

*   <a href="http://ecolincs.org/" target="_blank">Transition Lincoln</a> - Part of the Transition towns network, the group have organised skills shares, training weekends and film nights.
*   <a href="http://socialsciencecentre.org.uk/" target="_blank">The Social science centre</a> - A new higher education institution that is based on a cooperative, not for profit model.
*   <a href="http://www.thejollybrewer.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Jolly Brewer</a> - Our venue for the day and an awesome pub up for hosting all sorts of events.

*Have any of you been to Lincolnshire?*
