Firstly two from the infamous Mike Lieberman, <a href="http://www.greenrenters.org/2009/11/top-ten-green-renting-tips-from-nyc/" target="_self">who wrote a post for us last year</a> on how he is using left over coffee grounds to stop some of his potted plants going yellow, a problem that several of our plants also suffer from, <a href="http://www.urbanorganicgardener.com/2010/05/yellow-plant-leaves-use-coffee-grinds/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+UrbanOrganicGardener+%28Urban+Organic+Gardener%29&utm_content=Google+Reader" target="_blank">read more at his blog</a>.
