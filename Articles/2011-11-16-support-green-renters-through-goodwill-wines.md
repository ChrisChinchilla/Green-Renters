Like so many others on Black Saturday, the founder of Goodwill wines lost their home and their job, grateful to be alive and having no idea of the overwhelming support that would be provided. Using funds donated through the Red Cross Bushfire Appeal, Goodwill Wine was started as a way of paying forward the support and generosity shown by charitable organisations and the public.

The idea was simple To go directly to the vineyards and find some of the best value, boutique wines Australia has to offer, build a reputation based on a steadfast commitment to quality, pass on 50% of the profit margin to the charity or non-profit organisation of the purchasers choice.

Goodwill Wine aims to use these quality wines as a canvass to further awareness of the organisations supported, using beautifully personalised labels that reflect the nature of the specific cause. In acknowledging that there are over 700,000 charities and non-profit organisations in Australia, a Goodwill Label is also provided that enables the support of a charity or cause even if Goodwill Wine does not have a direct partnership with them.

Goodwill Wine offers a completely cost free service to all charities and non-profit organisations whether they be large NGO’s, big or small charities, schools or even the local footy club. The goal is to do all of the hard work and reward the supporter of good causes, with great value boutique wine while giving to the organisation closest to your heart.
