The South-West of England has a recent tradition of being leaders in the sustainability field, with the <a href="http://www.transitionnetwork.org/" target="_blank">Transition towns movement</a> founded in Totnes and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/3414714/Bristol-named-as-Britains-most-environmentally-sustainable-city.html" target="_blank">Bristol being named the UK's most sustainable city</a> a couple of years ago. We were staying with friends in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathford" target="_blank">Bathford</a> (Which had a well stocked and busy <a href="http://www.bathford.net/shop.php" target="_blank">community run shop</a>), a village on the outskirts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bath,_Somerset" target="_blank">Bath</a> and one of the most immediately striking features of Bath is that the vast majority of it is one colour, with most buildings resplendent in some degree of local yellow-ish Bath stone (Though probably more of a veneer these days and I wouldn't guarantee it's all genuine).

As with many other stops on our UK tour, we once again savoured a wide variety of local food and drink including:

*   Scrumptious ales from the likes of <a href="http://www.bathales.com/" target="_blank">Bath ales</a>, <a href="http://www.abbeyales.co.uk/" target="_blank">Abbey ales</a>, <a href="http://www.butcombe.com/" target="_blank">Butcombe ales</a> and the <a href="http://www.boxsteambrewery.com/" target="_blank">Box steam brewery</a>. Whilst Bath has many awesome watering holes, may I personally recommend the <a href="http://www.walcotstreet.com/" target="_blank">Bell Inn </a>as one of the most fantastic pubs I've visited. If you like pies, then you also must visit <a href="http://www.theravenofbath.co.uk/" target="_blank">the Raven</a> for nice drinks and near-perfect pies to suit herbivores as well as carnivores.
*   Soft drinks, hard drinks, curries, dairy, condiments, sweets, savouries and much more at the <a href="http://www.organicfoodfestival.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bristol Organic food festival</a> organised by the UK's <a href="http://www.soilassociation.org/" target="_blank">Soil association</a>. A large and varied event full of tastings, it was encouraging to see so many members of the public and companies willing to give organic, local and great tasting wares a go.

Whilst in the area we were invited to talk at a gathering of Sustainability professionals from the region, I spoke briefly for five minutes, in a vein attempt to tell everyone what we did and get people interested. We chatted with several interesting people and organisations, especially worth a brief mention is an 'ethical real estate agent', we hope to bring your more information on some of those in the near future.

Finally, a few links to organisations that you may find interesting:

*   <a href="http://www.bristolgreencapital.org" target="_blank">Bristol green capital</a>, something of an umbrella organisation funded by council to aid and assist other sustainability organisations in the city.
*   <a href="http://www.ecojam.org/" target="_blank">EcoJam</a>, a busy and bustling notice board for green events, jobs, organisations and more.
*   <a href="http://www.sustainablebristol.com" target="_blank">Sustainable Bristol</a>, a group of projects run by several organisations to encourage more sustainable lifestyles in the area.
*   <a href="http://www.bristolenergy.coop/" target="_blank">Bristol energy coop</a>, a community power organisation
*   <a href="http://www.createbristol.org/" target="_blank">The Create centre</a>, an eco centre where many of the organisations mentioned above are based.
