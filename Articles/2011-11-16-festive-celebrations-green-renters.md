The festive season is well and truly upon us and seeing as we've had a good and fruitful year, we're in high spirits and are pulling out all the stops to provide a few guiding hands to help you all have as sustainable and enjoyable festive season as possible.

We would also like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who has attended an event or workshop, read our articles, donated, become a member, spread the word or generally been supportive of what we do. If 2012 is anything like 2011, it's going to be a fantastic year and we look forward to hearing from you all soon.

**Join us for a festive celebration and workshop on Dec 15th**  
Topics include:

*   Green entertaining and parties
