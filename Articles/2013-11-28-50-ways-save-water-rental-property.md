### Kitchen

1.  Wash your dishes in a plugged sink rather than under a running tap or use a container such as the [the Hughie sink][1]
2.  Wash your vegetables in the plugged sink rather than under the tap
3.  Make flat soft drink into icecubes or use it to water the garden
4.  The most water efficient methods for cooking vegetables are microwaving, steaming or using a pressure cooker
5.  You can cut down on water loss when cooking by using tight lids on pots and simmering instead of boiling rapidly.
6.  Use a sink strainer rather than de-clogging the drain by running the tap.
7.  Soak pots and pans instead of letting the water run while you scrape them clean.
8.  Thaw frozen foods before you need them or use the microwave instead of placing them under running water
9.  Wash vegetables in the sink with a plug rather than under a running tap
10. For cold drinks keep a jug of water in the refrigerator instead of running the tap.
11. Designate one glass for your drinking water each day or refill a water bottle. This will cut down on the number of glasses to wash.

### Laundry

1.  Most washing machines have a load adjustment button or dial, so try to set this to match the amount of washing you're doing. If your machine doesn't have a load adjustment function, try to wait until you have enough washing for a full load.
2.  Collect grey water. If you use environmentally friendly washing detergent you can use the grey water on your garden
3.  Washing dark clothes in cold water saves both on water and energy while it helps your clothes to keep their colors.
4.  Only boil the quantity of water in the kettle which you need to fill your coffee cup.
5.  Consider whether items need washing or could be freshened by hanging outside

### Bathroom

 

1.  Check for toilet tank leaks by adding food coloring to the tank. If the toilet is leaking, color will appear within 30 minutes.
2.  Install a flow efficient shower head
3.  Turn the tap off whilst you brush your teeth.
4.  Use the minimum amount of water needed for a bath by closing the drain first and filling the bath only 1/3 full. Stopper bath before turning water. The initial burst of cold water can be warmed by adding hot water later.
5.  When it's yellow let it mellow, when it's brown flush it down
6.  If you don't have a dual flush toilet, full a 1.5 litre bottle with water, screw the lid on and put in the water tank to reduce the amount of water flushed.
7.  Keep a bucket in your shower. The collected water can be used to wash your floor or water your plants
8.  [Flush your toilet with grey water][2] instead of clean water which could be used on your plants
9.  <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Stick to four minute showers</span>
10. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Turn the tap off in the shower whilst soap your hair or shaving your legs. Devices such as the </span><a href="http://www.greenrenters.org/2010/04/the-shower-saver/" style="line-height: 1.5;">shower saver</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> can be a good resource to try</span>
11. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">To save water and time, consider washing your face or brushing your teeth while in the shower.</span>
12. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">When you are washing your hands, don't let the water run while you lather.</span>
13. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Don't use the toilet as an ashtray or rubbish bin.  Every time you flush a cigarette butt, facial tissue or other small bit of trash, a lot of water is wasted.</span>
14. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Short showers are more efficient than baths.</span>
15. <span style="line-height: 1.5;">When adjusting water temperatures, instead of turning water flow up, try turning it down. If the water is too hot or cold, turn the offender down rather than increasing water flow to balance the temperatures.</span>

### Everyroom

 

1.  Typcal taps discharge 15 to 18 litres per minute compared with low-flow and aerating models which use as little as 2 litres per minute.
2.  Avoid buying bottle water.
3.  Prevent taps from leaking by turning taps off lightly and replace washers as soon as they begin to leak.
4.  Monitor your water bill for unusually high use. Your bill and water meter are tools that can help you discover leaks.
5.  Know where your master water shut-off valve is located. This could save water and prevent damage to your home.
6.  [Lag your  hot water pipes][3] for more immediate hot water at the faucet and for energy savings.
7.  Report broken pipes, open hydrants and errant sprinklers to the property owner or your water provider.
8.  Be aware of and follow all water conservation and water shortage rules and restrictions which may be in effect in your area.
9.  Never put water down the drain when there may be another use for it such as watering a plant or garden, or cleaning.
10. Wash your bike and outdoor furniture with a bucket and sponge instead of a hose

### Garden

 

1.  Collect water from your roof to water your garden
2.  Spot water with a watering can instead of a hose
3.  Water your plants deeply but less frequently to encourage deep root growth and drought tolerance.
4.  Group plants with the same watering needs together to avoid overwatering some while underwatering others.
5.  Use a layer of organic material on the surface of your planting beds to minimize weed growth that competes for water.
6.  Consult with your local nursery for information on plant selection and placement for optimum outdoor water savings.
7.  Water only when necessary. More plants die from over-watering than from under-watering.
8.  For hanging baskets, planters and pots, place ice cubes under the moss or dirt to give your plants a cool drink of water and help eliminate water overflow.
9.  Water during the early parts of the day. Early morning is generally better than dusk since it helps prevent the growth of fungus and reduces water loss to evaporation. Watering early is also the best defence against slugs and other garden pests.
10. If you have a lawn, consider asking your landlord if it could be replaced by a low water garden.
