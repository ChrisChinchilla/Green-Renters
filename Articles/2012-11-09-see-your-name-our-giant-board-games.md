We've been trialling our <a href="http://www.greenrenters.org/project/green-games" style="color: #156734; text-decoration: none;">Green games</a> for several months and after tweaking the gameplay, it's time for them to become what they were always meant to be, GIANT 4m2 canvases that make the players the playing pieces!

*   *Perhaps you work for a plumber and they'd like to advertise on the "Your home has flooded" Rentopoly chance card?*
*   *Maybe you work at a bike shop and they'd like to advertise on the "Buy a bike" Rentopoly game square?*
*   *Love your pets? Name a square after them on Door Snakes and Ladders!*
*   *Know a small business or community group? There are many creative ways you could be involved with sponsoring aspects of the games, <a href="mailto:info@greenrenters.org" style="color: #156734; text-decoration: none;">talk to us</a> to brainstorm.*
*   *Or get the ultimate testament to your good self and just put your own name, street or family name on a game square or card! *



The games have proved a great way of educating on issues of sustainability, budgeting and renting. The games have appealed especially to families, passers by at events, schools, community groups and those who hadn't given much thought to sustainability before or are unlikely to pick up a leaflet or attend a workshop. We have so far achieved this with two prototype A0 sized board games 'Rentopoloy' and 'Door Snakes & Ladders', based on family favourites, 'Monopoly' and 'Snakes & Ladders'. They are simple and quick to play and help educate in a fun and engaging way.

We have a dozen bookings coming up over the next few months with schools, community centres and public events, all hoping we can take the GIANT games to them. *They have a potential audience of thousands of highly engaged players over the next year as well as mentions of sponsors on our busy websites and social media outlets*.

Printing 4m2 canvases is expensive, around $2,500 - $3,000 per game and we're seeking help in making this happen, **this is where you can play your part!**

We're using crowd-funding, where individuals and organisations are all invited to chip-in to help fund, instead of seeking one or two large backers. *However, if the funding target of $5,000 isn't reached, then every contribution is returned to the donor*.

There are a variety of benefits and incentives to thank donors, from personal thank yous, to your name on squares, Green Renters memberships and a free game session at your workplace, school or home.
