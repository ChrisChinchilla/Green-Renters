Food waste is a big problem in many homes, throwing away uneaten food wastes money and depletes natural resources. [We've featured a series of articles on ways to reduce food waste][1] such as shopping mindfully, managing leftovers and storing food correctly. One of the times that many people struggle to live sustainably in the kitchen is when they are poor, tired or busy. When you're tired or busy, it's easy to reach for packaging heavy fast food rather than shopping for and preparing a meal. When you're poor, you don't always have the luxury of food choices.

One thing that can help in big ways is having a range of meals in your freezer available for such times. It's good to have a hunt around for recipes that suit your budget and palate. There are a lot of websites devoted to freezer cooking, many even espouse batch cooking for a month at a time, but I find many lean too heavily on processed foods such as condensed soup. But they are good to look at for possibilities and ideas.

## General tips for batch cooking

<ul style="">
  <li>
    Plan ahead, check what ingredients you all ready have at home before buying in more.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you have freezer space. Might be a good time to clean out the fridge.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider batch cooking with others. You can join a club like the fantastic ones organised at Mamabake or you could just invite a few friends over or cook with your housemate.
  </li>
  <li>
    What will you store your meals in? Some people use plastic containers, some use glass. A good technique for freezing soup or chili is to ladle it into ziploc-style freezer bags. One quart-size bag will hold two generous adult servings. Write the name and date on them with a permanent marker. Then stack the bags flat to freeze them. They won’t take up much room in the freezer and because the bags are thin, they defrost really quickly. To defrost, place the frozen bag of soup or chili in a sink of water for 30 minutes. Then pour it in a pot to heat up on the stove. The bags can be washed, dried and reused many times.

  <li>
    Seasonal fruit and vegetables are usually freshest and most affordable.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also cut and freeze portions of veggies (avoid watery ones like lettuce)
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider cooking up some rice to also freeze in small serves
  </li>
  <li>
    Make sure you label what you cook. Really. I know someone who made pasta sauce using mince for christmas mince pies!
  </li>
  <li>
    Every so often have a look and see what's in your freezer, it could be a welcome surprise!
  </li>
  <li>
    Never re-freeze food, it's dangerous.
