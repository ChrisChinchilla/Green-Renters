From *Lamby Loves Cake*:

> '**After making up my own batch of washing powder (thanks to Green Renters) to save on dollars at the supermarket, I turned my attention to delicious but pricey Carmans muesli bars we love so much.** **This recipe makes the equivalent of two boxes for the price of one - the only thing tricky about this is spelling muesli!'**

**Ingredients**:

*   Five cups of your favourite cereal - I use organic oat, fruit and nut breakfast mix
*   Half a cup of butter
*   Half a cup of honey
*   One third of a cup of brown sugar
*   One teaspoon of Arabic all spice or cinnamon
*   One teaspoon of vanilla extract

**Method**:

1.  Put your cereal on a baking tray and toast it in the oven until its slightly golden - the longer you do it for the crunchier it will be
2.  In a small pot, melt the butter, honey, brown sugar and vanilla - bring to a simmer
3.  Chuck your toasted cereal in a bowl and add your all spice or cinnamon
4.  Add your hot gooey honey butter mixture and stir through until properly combined
5.  Press the mix into a shallow dish, making sure it's packed in tight
6.  Cover with foil and leave in the fridge for 2 hours
7.  Take it out, cut it into bars and you have yourself a snack for half the price!!!!
