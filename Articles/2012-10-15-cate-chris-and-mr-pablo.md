  ***1. Who resides in your home?***  Cate, Chris and Mr Pablo (16 year old rescue cat)

***  2. Type of property***  We live in a semi-detached town house which is over 120 years old. It joins with a row of houses, several of which are owned by the same family and included a front garden and rear courtyard.

***  3. Location*** Brunswick, Vic (Australia)

***  4. How long have you lived there  ***Cate (8 years) Chris (5 years) Mr Pablo (18 months))

***  5. Favourite room in your house ***  
Cate: Probably the kitchen. We really enjoy cooking and making food to share with our friends. Chris is great at making mexican food and stir fries and I like testing new recipes and baking scones. I'm making some preserved oranges at the moment. We run some of our jam and preserve making workshops from our home, proving that you don't need a brand new industrial style kitchen to achieve things.

Chris: The office as it has all my things around me, I know where everything is and I have a great desk by a sunny window.

***  6. ******Favourite posession ***  
Cate: I'm not sure I could come up with just one thing but we're both big fans of vintage and retro designs and well as hand made so we have lots of prints and wall hangings and vintage nic naks. I collect far too many things such as Pyrex dishes, tin toys, embroideries and tea towels. None of them are really worth anything but they make the house feel like home to me and make me happy to have them around me.

**  7. Biggest challenge of your home**  
Our place is really old and the maintenance is limited unless we do it ourselves. The place tends to look a bit grubby even when it's just been cleaned.  Structurally the place lacks storage cupboards and spaces so we have keep our spare linen in a suitcase and big jam making pots under the bed. The living room is quite small so we tend to socialise most in the warmer months when we can have people in the garden. It would be nice to have more space...

  8. Why are you a green renter?  
We all have a part to play in looking after this earth of ours. It would be easy to say *oh poor me. I can't afford to own a home so I can't do anything,* but that's not really accurate. We can all make choices in what we buy, what cleaning products we use, how much water and electricity we utilise and our general lifestyle, renters and home owners alike.

**  9. What are three sustainability tips that can help other renters?:**

1.  **Draught proofing. **Most rental properties fall into two main camps with the same end result. They are either an old, badly maintained building with cracks, gaps, holes, no insulation, and ill-fitting doors and windows, or a modern, poorly made building sharing at least several of the same characteristics. Door snakes, insulation tape and thermal lined curtains are a great help to make the temperature of your home more comfortable.
2.  **Save utilitie use and money in the laundry. **Wash clothing in cold water and use a clothes line or drying rack instead of a dryer. Much better for the environment and saves you money.
3.  **Reduce your food waste. **Australians throw away 20% of the food in their kitchen. Monitor your waste over a week and see whether you are cooking too much, storing food incorrectly or not using leftover before buying more food.
