I remember a few years back when we all thought that the computerisation of offices would herald the reduction of paper consumption. This never seemed to happen. In fact, paper consumption since computerisation has actually increased, with most people not thinking before printing and wasting trees on a variety of pointless documents. This is a personal bugbear of mine. I hate wasting paper and look for as many ways as possible to limit my usage. I'm perfectly happy to read digital copies and reuse paper so imagine my excitement when I found Lifehacker's <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5330558/the-complete-guide-to-going-paperless" target="_blank">complete guide to going paperless</a>! Enjoy :-)
