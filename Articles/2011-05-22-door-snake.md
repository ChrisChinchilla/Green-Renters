These doorsnakes are handmade by us in Brunswick and are lovingly crafted out of attractive recycled materials. An easy and convenient way to draught proof your doors and rooms. Our doorsnakes average 75cm in length. We are happy to make a range of sizes and colours upon request and also welcome bulk orders.

*These door snakes are filled with recycled wadding made from PET plastic bottles and pre-loved fabrics. They do not contain wheat, sand or any other type of organic material, so will not attract vermin.*

<small>We use the recommended Australia Post postage calculator for our orders. It is not always accurate. If you are overcharged for postage we will always reimburse you after posting. If you live in Melbourne, you are also very welcome to organise pick up from Brunswick.Â </small>

<small>Our door snakes are hand made to every order, during busy times (i.e. winter!), please allow sufficient time for your order to be delivered. We will endeavor to keep you up to date about progress. Colours listed are simply stock photos and do not indicate current fabric available.</small>
