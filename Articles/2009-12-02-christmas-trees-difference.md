As a renter I don't really see the point of store bought Christmas trees. They're synthetic and kinda ugly and we have no where to store them inbetween Christmases (like most rental properties, storage cupboards are lacking). I don't see in the point of a cut tree, and the potted variety seem to die off in the summer heat anyway.

I also should mention that we don't really have the space for a big Christmas tree, our living room is quite small!

So I was excited to see these photos of DIY christmas trees using household objects...

The first three are from[ here][1]. The ladder looks great and I like it as it doesn't take up too much space. The second photograph is of an old drying rack, I think something similar could definitely be made with an old clothes horse!

The [harddisk Christmas tree][2] is a hilarious use discarded discs, whether cd's, or computer disks!

And the [pinecone tree][3] is great for traditionalists who want the pinecone smell :)

[I like the idea of making a ][2][junk mail][4] Christmas tree out of all the junk mail that seems to arrive in the letter box, even with a 'no advertising' sticker.
