We've reported on a few cases of 'Greenwash' in the past and it's something that particularly annoys us. What irritates us is that companies are cashing in on consumer's fears and ignorance in order to sell them over-priced and under-achieving products. Obviously we're not alone as I came across an entire site dedicated to increasing awareness (in a humorous way) about 'The Sins of Greenwash'. Enjoy!
