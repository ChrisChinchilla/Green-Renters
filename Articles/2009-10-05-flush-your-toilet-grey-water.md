Do you know how much water goes down the toilet everyday? Well, quite a bit... We've already bestowed the virtues of not needed to flush every time "*If it's yellow let it mellow, if it's brown wash it down*", lets take it one stage further, in our house we generate a fair amount of grey water from the shower and washing machine and don't have a whole lot do with it, especially in wetter months, so putting two and two together, why not flush the toilet with it?

It sounds a little gross, but is very easy to do and it made me realise that even on a half flush the toilet uses around a bucket of water. We'll show you what we did, but your toilet may be different.

1.  Firstly, turn the tap off that feeds water into the cistern, you can always turn it back on if you run out of grey water.
2.  Take off the cistern's lid, in our case there was a clip on both sides of the lid.
3.  Pour your water in to the cistern (And I hazard a bet that most of yours look as manky as ours)
4.  Flush, in our case it's the lever below, left hand side for half flush, right hand side for full
5.  Close the cistern and repeat as needed, easy!
