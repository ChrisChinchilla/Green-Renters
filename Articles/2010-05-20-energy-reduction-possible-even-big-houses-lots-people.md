    TODAY'S teenager is wired up. TVs, DVDs, Xboxes and PlayStations, Wiis and mobile phones, iPods and Kindles, laptops, printers, cameras and hair straighteners are all considered as essential as oxygen. And there's the typical teenage behaviour: opening the fridge door every 10 minutes, habitually leaving lights on, countless hours of TV. Which raises the question: just how much does living with a teenager cost? Karen and Steve Hulse have three teenagers: university student Andrew, 19; VCE student Danielle, 17; and Emily, 13. Each quarter they get a $1300 electricity bill - $5200 a year.
  </p>

    The Hulse family and their dog, Bella, live in a two-storey home in Brighton. All five have their own computer and printer and personal devices such as mobile phones and iPods, electric shavers and hair straighteners. Upstairs are the bedrooms, the master with spa in en suite and a kids retreat with television and console games. They also have ducted vacuuming and air-conditioning and an outdoor entertaining pavilion by the pool, which has an oven and stove-top, heaters, ceiling fan, lights, flat-screen television and a bar fridge, bringing their total number of refrigeration units to four. Andrew, Danielle and Emily do not believe they use too much power. As students, they spend long hours studying, and with other extra-curricular activities to occupy them, things such as console games are only played infrequently. Sharing the TV and DVD players means they are not running multiples of those appliances at the same time. And they say that being Generation Y, they have been raised with an awareness of environmental issues.

    ''At school, all science is about global warming and the environment,'' says Danielle.
  </p>

    Andrew, who is studying a double degree in civil engineering and business, agrees. ''Uni has given me the impetus to change.'' The other impetus to change is the family's $1300 bill. ''It's a real sore point!'' says Karen, of the discussion that comes up every time the bill arrives. She jokes that each of them blames the other and it ends up as a ''brawl''. But she says they don't see it as a laughing matter.

    The family made a concerted effort to be more conscious of their energy use and were disappointed to find no reduction in their bills. ''We looked at the kilowatts - the usage - and it was increased or within the same ballpark, despite a huge effort,'' says Karen. As they had not added any new appliances to the mix, they were puzzled. Who was using all the power - the teenagers or the entire family? Origin retail energy advisor Anne Armansin is an energy-efficiency expert. She visited the Hulse family to conduct an energy audit and see where they could lower consumption. This involved reviewing their bills, talking with the family about who uses what, then going into every room and testing each device with a Power Mate, which determines how much energy is being used at a particular time.

    ''If I were to leave it on all day, it would accumulate and let us know how much [is used in a day]. It's good for things that cycle on and off, like your refrigerator. Fridges should cycle on about 30 per cent of the time but a lot of older fridges and those that aren't maintained very well can run 100 per cent of the time and cost far too much to run,'' says Ms Armansin. Based on her findings, she prepares a report recommending where savings can be made.

    As she makes her way through the house, on her hands and knees at powerpoints and under desks and behind furniture, she warns of standby power. A survey in 2005 of 140 homes around Australia determined that homes had, on average, 67 appliances that plugged in. About 25 of those used standby power.

    ''That led them to come up with the figure of 92.5 watts running continuously. Now for the average Victorian home that represented 10 per cent of power consumption at that time,'' says Ms Armansin. ''Power is measured in kilowatt hours, so 1000 watts operating for one hour is a kilowatt hour. All of these little things that you have throughout the house are going to add up, but those things if you want to make big savings are going to be air conditioning, clothes drying, pool filters,'' says Ms Armansin.
  </p>

    Teenagers can add to the bill simply because they stay at home longer these days, says Ms Armansin. There is also the proliferation of electrical devices. However, the Hulse family uses between three and five times more electricity than the average Origin Victorian household (which consumes 5000 to 8000 kilowatt hours a year). This is partly because they have double the average household size.
  </p>

    ''The Hulse family essentially is made up of five adults and the 'average household' according to Census 2006 consists of 2.6 persons,'' says Ms Armansin. In her audit of their 83 appliances, she was able to recommend $1800 in annual savings, ranging from no-cost behavioural changes to big investments for long-term savings. Turning the TV off at the set will save them 920 kWh a year. Cutting pool filtering time from eight hours to three hours a day in the colder months will save 1880 kWh a year, or $474. Ms Armansin also advised replacing the old, inefficient freezer in the garage <br class="spacer_" />

It further challenges the idea I've heard a lot recently, that environmental changes in the home are simply too hard in a big house with lots of people.</em>
