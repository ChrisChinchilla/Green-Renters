**Why do it:**

Clothing swaps are fun, economical and envuronemntal friendly. Get rid of clothing you’ve never or rarely warn in exchange for new (to you) items. If you’re not so into fashion the same process works wonderfully other kinds of swaps including:

o   Books

o   Homemade preserves

o   DVDs and CDs

o   Kitchenware

o   Children’s toys

**Tips for hosting a clothing swap**

**Consider the logistics of the event**

*   Where will you hold the event? This largely depends on whether you are doing a swap with a few mates or a bigger event including people outside of your family and social circle.
*   Where will people try on clothing?
*   Do you have full length mirrors?
*    Are there any costs involved? These may include hiring a hall for a bigger event, table and clothing rack hire or serving champagne.
*   Will it be free or include an entry fee. For example, $5 per person might include a glass of champagne
*   Is your event specific to a particular cohort of people such as plus sized, tall people, men or women or a particular style of clothing such as vintage?
*   How will you manage the logistics of the swap? Some options might include:

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">-Tokens for every item someone donates. If you donate 5 items you get five tokens to ‘spend’</span>

-Everyone gets the same number of items as they swap

-A value system so a Gucci bag is worth more in tokens than a scarf from H&M

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">-Draw straws and take turns shopping, limiting each person to five minutes and one item per round to keep things moving. </span>

-Free for all. People can take what they like but if more than one person wants the same item they can both try it on and the other guests decides who looks best in it.

**Planning the event**  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">It is a good idea to provide interested attendees with some guidelines before attending on what items they can swap. The general rule seems to be clean, laundered items in good condition including clothing, shoes, scarves, handbags, hats, shoes and accessories. Put it in writing.</span>

*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Get people to drop of their goods before hand. Perhaps the day before</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Display items invitingly. This could be by type of item, colour or size. You could also </span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">group  items together in different areas. For example, put skirts in one corner and tops in another. </span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Hang up dresses and jackets on a garment rack or curtain rod, neatly fold sweaters and trousers, and organize jewellery on a table to make the merchandise look more appealing.</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Put on some music</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Ensure good lighting</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Enlist volunteers to ensure that tried on items are returned to where they came from and rearranged neatly for others to try</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Set a time limit for swapping</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Take unwanted items to a charity store</span>
*   <span style="line-height: 1.5;">Have fun and enjoy some fashions you never would have tried on otherwise!</span>
