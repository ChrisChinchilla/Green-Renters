We had a little give away of a DIY container garden of herbs. It sadly looked a bit dilapidated by the end of the day but the idea was certainly well intended!

Particular highlights were the workshops on Wicking, window gardening and growing your own sprouts. I also enjoyed a workshop on mushroom growing. I'd like to buy a box mushroom kit to grow in the laundry, but I'm waiting for the weather to get a bit better as you need a pretty even temperature for them to succeed.I haven't had a chance to try [wicking][5] but I did try growing my own sprouts using David Dawson's method. I'll post up a tutorial soon.
