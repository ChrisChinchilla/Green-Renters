**Things you need:**

*   Clean sterilised jars (you don't need the lid)
*   Muslin fabric
*   Rubber bands
*   Sprout seeds (you could try alfalfa, mustard, mung beans or even radish and broccoli seeds)
*   Water
*   Bucket

**Directions**

1.  Put a tablespoon of seeds in your jar. Add a small amount of water to cover the seeds, and top with a small piece of muslin and a rubber band. Ensure the muslin is wet. Shake jar gently and leave for 4-6 hours in a light spot.
2.  Fill your jar with a small amount of water and drain by tipping upside down and letting it leak through the muslin into a bucket. Shake the seeds gently and lie the jar on it's side. Repeat this process 2-3 times a day, ensuring that the muslin is always wet and the seeds are damp.
3.  Within 2-3 days your seeds will start to sprout.Here's mine after a week:

What I like most about them is that they are a bright vivid green, unlike the rather pale offering that you can buy at the supermarket. I've had mine for over a week and they are still fresh and not slimy or moldy. A great little project requiring few materials with a great outcome! If you are wondering what to do with your sprouts once you grow them, here's a [website][3] I found with some ways to incorporate sprouts into your meals.
