In this workshop, we look at the ways renters can save energy and reduce their utility bills. Participants learn how to read utility bills, find out which appliances are the biggest energy suckers, how to make their appliances work more efficiently, and how to resolve issues with energy providers.

<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Participants can expect an energy reduction of up to 30% on their utility bills as a result of making changes in their homes. This workshop is available as a one-off or as a ‘before’ and ‘after’ two-part workshop where we provide a follow up three months later to look at how their energy saving has gone.</span>
