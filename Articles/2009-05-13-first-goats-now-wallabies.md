We wrote last week about Google using goats to mow their lawn, now wallabies are the next thing!

FORGET sheep or the Victa lawnmower, British gardeners are turning to Aussie wallabies to keep their lawns trim. So big is the demand for lawn cutting wallabies, there is a waiting list at Britain’s biggest private supplier. Trevor Lay, owner of <a class="media-search-keyword" href="http://search.news.com.au/search//0/?us=ndmnews&sid=401&as=news&ac=ninews2&q=Waveney Wildlife" title="Search for more about Waveney Wildlife  across the News Network">Waveney Wildlife </a>in Bungay, Suffolk which supplies wallabies to zoos and animal parks in Britain, told The Times demand from private individuals is soaring. He said five years ago he received the odd inquiry from private individuals. Now demand is now so high that he's breeding 35 a year. "It's crazy. To be honest, if I had 100 I could easily get rid of them," he said. But the wallabies aren't cheap. They cost £150($297) for a male and £600 to £700 for a female. They are sold in pairs because wallabies like living in a social group. They need plenty of space for them to roam and a fence or wall at least 1.5m high. They would be useless as security guards, though. Mr Lay said: "They'd run a mile from a burglar or stranger. They are timid creatures and really harmless but adults will growl if their young are threatened. And they don't like dogs." Richard Sheepshanks is waiting for a pair of wallabies who will graze his 4ha of land at Rendlesham Hall, near Woodbridge, Suffolk. "I have a wife, four children under the age of five, and we already have a menagerie with seven dogs, five sheep and four peacocks. I could use sheep to keep down the grass but they are messy and stupid," he told The Times. "We have a walled garden separated from the main house which has a 7.5m outer and 3m inner wall but it's a bit wild and the grass needs keeping down. "The wallabies will live there and be kept away from the dogs, which can easily stress them. I am sure in time, though, that they will get used to the dogs and everyone will get on famously."
