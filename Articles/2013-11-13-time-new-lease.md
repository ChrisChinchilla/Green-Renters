<span><strong>2013 has been a fantastic year for Green Renters</strong>. it’s been one of our busiest, with a plethora of workshops and projects and lots of other exciting developments. It has also been a year in which we have seen renters increasingly recognised including developments such as </span><span class="s2">the biggest overhaul of  NSW strata legislation in over 50 years and the Victoria Greens tabling Rental Health law in Victorian Parliament.</span>

*<span>However after 4 years Cate and I are ready to move on to new ventures, ideas, campaigns and projects.</span>*

<span>As an organisation we are weighing up handing the reins over to a new individual (or most likely, several individuals), wrapping up completely or merging what we do into a new organisation. Some of these discussions need to be had with our board and members, but also, we’d like to know what people out there think, hence this post!</span>

<span>If you may be interested in becoming more involved with the running of Green Renters then please get in touch, before you do, here are a few points to be aware of:</span>

<li class="p2">
  <span>Whilst we have had a great growth in interest over the past few years, Green Renters currently brings in enough income for one full time employee. This is currently spread between two part time staff and several contractors.</span>
</li>
<li class="p2">
  <span>The above point implies that there will be a lot of work that is unpaid and unexpected. This is the nature of passion-driven projects, there are no guarantees and you just have to go with what happens and sometimes learn as you go.</span>
</li>
<li class="p3">
  <span>A good spread of skills is essential. Neither of us are environmental scientists or </span><span>have formal sustainability qualifications</span><span>. </span><span>Community development, marketing, grant writing, corporate funding and philanthropy, membership services, volunteer management, copywriting, public speaking, writing and teaching workshops are perhaps a bigger part of the skills needed for the organisation rather than pure sustainability knowledge</span><span>. </span>
</li>
<li class="p3">
  <span>We are a not for profit organisation with charity status. We are governed by a volunteer board of management derived from our financial members who determine the direction of Green Renters in response to feedback we receive from members, trends in renting and sustainability and renters needs. As a registered charity we are guided by legislative requirements. For example, profits must go to the organisation rather than the staff of the organisation. We have made the decision in doing this to allocate profits to subsiding free workshops and the like rather than to fund a physical office, bigger compliment of staff or company cars. This is not the case in all charities.</span>
</li>

<p class="p4">
  <span>It’s worth noting that all these factors apply in the way we have been running the organisation, it doesn’t mean they have to stay like that.</span>
</p>

<p class="p5">
  <span>All of those ‘pragmatic’ points aside, we are an exciting organisation that operates in an innovative manner and this could be a great opportunity for someone looking for a new challenge.</span>
