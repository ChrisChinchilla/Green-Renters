Stalls are often a part of a community event or festival. At Green Renters we got asked hundreds of times to do a stall at various sustainability events. When you are new, it is easy to be flattered by the idea that people want to give you a voice, but running stalls can be exhausting.  I've written a bit about stalls vs pop up workshops over [here ][1]but here's a few more thoughts you need to ask yourself before you sign up for a stall:

<strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">What is the purpose of your stall and how will you show this?</strong>

It might be:

*   to raise awareness of your cause
*   get the opinions of the public (a survey? vox pox)
*   raise awareness of who you are and what you do
*   raise revenue (sell something)

When we first started Green Renters we naively decided that we didn't want to do lots of brochures and flyers. We were a sustainability organisation and there was enough paper fluttering around as it was. We made a few QR codes and a mailing list for our first ever stall. The problem was that some people didn't want to sign up to a mailing list, no one had heard of QR codes and everyone kept asking us if we had a flyer.

It needs to be apparent to the passing eye who you are and what you do. This can be difficult. We had some people think we rented out plants or ran a nursery (even when we had no plants on display). 

We also learnt that if you have a stall (unless you have a table of products you are selling to provide interest) you need to provide a reason for people to stop. You get better at this with experience. We got flyers and big A3 posters listing upcoming events/workshops or issues we were trying to promote. We bought a roll up banner to make our stall eye catching. We included a table of props including sustainability tools relevant to renters. Where possible we would include a mini workshop at our stall like making bathbombs or natural washing powder.

Include a mailing list by all means but imore importantly make sure your flyers have your email address and facebook account so people can contact you.

  <strong>What is the event?</strong>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.0063037872314px;">
  Is it a new event? What other stall holders do they have (or have they asked)? How many people attended last year? What are the draw cards? Is the event competing with any other events that day?
</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.0063037872314px;">
  <strong>Is this relevant/of benefit to you and/or your cause?</strong>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.0063037872314px;">
  As I mentioned earlier, we would regularly get asked to staff a stall at various community events. Sometimes these events had not all that much relevance to renters or there had been no effort to create an event which was inclusive of the needs of renters. For example, with invitations we would have to consider if the event included opportunities for meaningful participation like workshops or forums (assuming we were asked) or was our inclusion simply to tick on a box on an inclusiveness criteria somewhere. Renters are an often overlooked part of the community particularly in regard to discourse about sustainability, housing and urban planning. Therefore an event about housing (for example) should include more about renters than simply a stall by Green Renters. It is always worth talking to the organising if you feel you have something to offer an event which goes beyond holding a simple stall, it may give you other opportunities in the future, if not at this event.

  <span style="line-height: 1.538em;"><strong>What's the intended audience and does it correlate with who you want to reach?</strong> </span>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 13px; line-height: 20.0063037872314px;">
  <span style="line-height: 1.538em;">We often were asked to attend sustainability events in the outer suburbs of Melbourne. We were happy to do this at times, but typically found that very few renters would attend such events and most people would avoid us as they thought we weren't relevant to them. </span>

**Where is your stall?**

Get a map of stallholders in the first instance or be familar with a potential space. There's nothing worse than being stuck down in some corner out of the way of the main events. Distance from car park or public transport might also be a pain if you have a lot of stuff to carry. 

 

<strong style="line-height: 1.538em;">How is the event promoted?</strong>

There's nothing worse than turning up to an event to find a row of smiling stall holders and team of anxious organisers wondering where the audience is. Do your homework and make sure there's enough to draw people in. 

**When is the event?**

Many sustainability folks will remember the pain of staffing a stall in the roasting hot Melbourne summer for the Sustainable Living Festival. The inside of tent is 50 degrees celcius plus and you speak each afternoon with the burning sun in your face. If it's really hot or pouring rain, people may stay away in droves. 

**<span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Is there a cost to hold a stall?</span>**

The number of times we got asked to hold a stall at some big sustainability event which was organised by a big corporate events company... We'd enquire if they had any discounts for not for profits of our size and type and find that the discount was still outside of our reach to be financially viable. If we had had a bigger team and a bigger budget, such events may at times have been of benefit in reaching renters (or organisations that would be interested in hosting our workshops) but it was a risk that we never really had the financial luxury to undertake. I might add, whilst we had an online shop, we weren't necessarily making enough sales from our small suite of products the odd time we took them to an event to ensure that a bulk order was financially viable and would pay for the costs of a stall. The problem with Green Renters was that unlike some other organisations we weren't selling a product like a book or a mug or what have you that enough people who buy to make a decent profit. We were often offered opportunities to create something to sell (like a branded Keep Cup) but we didn't want to just sell something branded for the sake of it, especially when so many small businesses came (and went) selling green products. 

It's also worth being aware of what you get for a paid stall. Is there a marquee and table and chairs or do you have to bring your own? Are you listed in the official program and social media shout outs with the appropriate links etc? If the event is for more than one day, do you get to leave your stuff overnight in a locked/guarded space? 

I mention all of these issues, not to deter people from holding a stall per se, more to give you some practical considerations before you enthusiastically agree to spend weekend after weekend being the public face of your organisation. 

**Do you have any special requirements?**

If you are selling goods you may need a permit or be charged extra by the event organisers. If you are selling food you need a food permit. Do you need power or lighting? 

**Who will staff the stall?**

You generally need at least two people to staff a stall to ensure that people are able to have breaks and chat to people properly. if you can, set up a roster of people to staff the stall in two, three or four hour shifts. Make sure that volunteers are properly briefed with clear instructions on the location, times, contact details etc and that you have everyone's contact details to hand. Have a couple of back up options if people are unable to make it if you can. 

 

We wrote a volunteer manual for stallholders (and other tasks at Green Renters and also made up a check list of things to bring to stall (with some variation each time).
