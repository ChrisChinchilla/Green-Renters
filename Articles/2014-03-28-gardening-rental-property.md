People in rental properties are often confounded intially by the idea of gardening. What about when I move? What if I'm not allowed? What is the point? In simple terms, by<span> growing as many edibles as you can, you are making your lifestyle more sustainable. The initial outlay for potting mix, compost and accessories will be well and truly be offset by the amount of money you save buying household vegies, herbs and fruit. Growing your own food at home also reduces your carbon footprint (less trips to the shops, less packaging), and saves you stacks of time. </span>

*Even in the tiniest abode, sprouting is a great way to get home grown nutrients.*

**<span>Ok I have a backyard/garden, but I don't know what's allowed?</span>**  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Check your lease and have a chat with the owner or property. Tenancy law stipulates that changes to property by tenants must either be returned to the original state when the lease commenced or be only carried out with the permission on the owner, depending on what state you reside it. It's worth checking. Your idea of a fully self suffiicent backyard with permacultured plots and aquaponic bath tubs might be celebrated by your landlord or must be removed (at your expense) and returned to tan bark and a lone tree upon your departure.</span>

At the very least it's worth focusing on what you can do whether it's a window garden, balcony of pot plants or hanging baskets. All can be enjoyable and highly fruitful.

  <b>What can I grow in pots?</b>
</p>

  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/gardening/plants/vegetables/allotments/8102987/Balcony-plot-really-pays-off.html">P</a>ic from <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/VERTICAL-VEGETABLES-quotGrow-upquot-in-a-smal/step6/Add-plants-or-seeds/">here</a>
</p>

<li class="p2">
  <span>Any edible plants can be grown in containers. Potted herbs are a popular choice and can be placed in a sunny window or even on a patio. Herbs are compact so they can easily be grown in a small space. Try chives, mint, basil, parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, and more.</span>
</li>
<li class="p2">
  You can even grow fruit trees in containers. Dwarf varieties of trees such as orange, fig, apple, and pear can (with some effort) grow in large containers. These usually need to be protected or brought inside during the winter. 
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Strawberries are another fruit easily grown in a pot; there are even special terra cotta pots with holes in them that are widely available. 
</li>
<li class="p2">
  If vegetables are what you want, try greens such as arugala, lettuces, rainbow chard, and spinach. Smaller varieties of tomatoes, peas, pole beans, bush zucchini, and peppers can also be grown successfully with some staking or trellis for them to climb.
</li>

<p class="p2">
  <b>What kind of container should I use?</b><br /> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">You want a vessel that has enough space for the roots of your plant, proper nutrients to feed your plant, and drainage holes to allow for excess moisture to flow out to prevent waterlogged roots.</span>
</p>

<p class="p2">
  Grab pots in different sizes and shapes. Even big buckets and old bins work brilliantly. Terracotta looks great but be aware it heats up quickly in summer and will require more watering than plastic pots. 
</p>

<p class="p2">
  The other thing you can do with plastic pots is disguise them. Place your planted pots in the appropriate space in the backyard, grab some wide plastic trellis mesh, a couple of stakes and a bale of pea straw. Wrap the mesh around the pot, leaving about an inch gap between the pot and the mesh, attach the stakes to the mesh and hammer them in. Then, simply chop off any excess mesh width and stuff the area between the mesh and the pot with pea straw. Use the left over pea straw to mulch the pot plant. The result is a really <span style="font-size:12px;">rustic looking, permanent appe</span>aring pot disguise, for the princely some of about $10 a pot (including the pot!). <span>It also insulates the pots and stops it heating up and damaging the delicate young plant roots. </span>

  <strong>Living with a balcony?</strong>
</p>

<li class="p2">
  Gain an understanding of your balcony environment. Is it shady or sunny? How much weight can the balcony bear (might want to reconsider those cement pots)?
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Is it windy? You'll need sturdy pots, perhaps staked and extra water to compensate.
</li>
<li class="p2">
  Does your watering affect the neighbours below? Could be really awkward if it dirty water lands on their designer cushions
</li>

<span><b>Communal areas</b></span>  
<span>No garden in site but share a communal courtyard? Is could be a veritable oasis of plump tomatoes and fragrant herbs with a little enthusiasm. Perhaps start by gauging interest by holding communal drinks  where you can chat to fellow tenants. Get permission of the Owners Corporation. This could be just the beginning of creating a shared space for everyone to enjoy outdoor meals, barbecues and gardening. </span>
