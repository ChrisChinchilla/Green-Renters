  Easter is coming! Whether you celebrate it as a Christian rebirth, a paegan time of renewal or a chocolate lover's license to indulge, this is the time where your purchasing power and how you choose to celebrate really does count.

**Things you can do** :

**Buy Fairtrade Chocolate**  
Buying Fairtrade Certified Easter Eggs and chocolate helps tackle the issues of child trafficking and labour - both major problems resulting from cocoa production. You can get many fair trade chocolate brands at your local supermarket or speciality shops. You can see a list of stockists [<span style="color: rgb(68, 136, 136);">here</span>][1].

**Support Easter Bilbies**  
Consider an [<span style="color: rgb(68, 136, 136);">Easter bilby</span>][2], to support conservation efforts to secure the breeding of wild bilbies.

**Shop local**  
Consider support small local businesses. Buy handmade chocolates or hot cross buns from a local store, cafe or health food shop. There's also homemade jams and chutney, even home made beer! Non-food gifts are also a good bet. Bulbs are wonderful this time of year and seeds are always well received. A plant is always a better gift than a purchased bunch of flowers.

**Make it yourself**  
Maybe you'd like to make your own [hot cross buns][3]?. It's a great way to learn a new skill and cooking in bulk can reduce packaging and gives you the opportunity to personalise your buns: Chocolate chips? Nuts? Peel? You decide!

**Decorate it yourself**  
Skip the chocolate and decorate free range eggs yourself with natural dyes or even coloured textas at home. Get the kids involved!

**Catering the green way**

Having friends over for Sunday easter lunch? There's lots of ways you can make your meal sustainabile.

*   Use RSVP's as guide for cooking quantities to avoid food wate
*   Shop [seasonally][4]: figs, nectarines, plums, tomatoes, zucchinis are beetroot are all wonderful this time of year.
*   Where possible, buy food from your local market or farmer's market
*   Consider cold seagood such as calamari, octopus, whiting or oysters and check of the [Sustainable Seafood Guide][5]
*   For a large crowd consider a keg or punch over cans and small bottles
*   Enjoy beer and wine from local wineries and microbreweries.

      <strong>Focus on experiences not food</strong><br /> Spending time with loved ones is the best gift of all. Host a pot luck where everyone brings a dish. Put on a film night outside. Organise a picnic. Camping and holidaying is a popular Australian easter past time.
