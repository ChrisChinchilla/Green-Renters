There have been a variety of phone apps released that claim green credentials, guides to products, carbon emission trackers and much more. Having recently acquired a shiny new iPhone I was intrigued to find out what was available, I was pleased to find a fair amount of genuinely helpful and well put together apps, the only (major for us) drawback was that pretty much every single one was US only. Still, for any of our international visitors, this post may be helpful and personally, I've decided to contact some of the developers and ask about being involved in creating localised versions of their applications. **<img alt="header_logo" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-818" height="68" src="/sites/default/files/images/header_logo2.png" style="margin: 6px;" title="header_logo" width="283" />Good guide** [ www.goodguide.com][1] A slick, (seemingly) well researched app with plenty of information on 1000s of products, their nutritional value and ethical scores. **<img alt="1" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-819" height="41" src="/sites/default/files/images/1.gif" style="margin: 6px;" title="1" width="288" />Locavore** [ www.enjoymentland.com/locavore][2] An app that tells you what food is currently in season in your area. **<img alt="logo" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-820" height="90" src="/sites/default/files/images/logo.png" style="margin: 6px;" title="logo" width="90" />Green Meter** [www.hunter.pairsite.com/greenmeter][3] An app that evaluates your driving style and choice of vehicle, advising you on how to become a more efficient driver.
