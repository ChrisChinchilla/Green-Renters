**Day 1: Consideration of our challenges**

We've signed up to be part of the City of Moreland's [Zero Waste for a Week][1] challenge. As the name suggests, the challenge is to live for a week without producing waste (besides that which can be recycled, composted or green wasted). The comic above is a bit cheeky but it's also true based on organisations I've worked for!

As part of the challenge we received a package of goodies in the post: a Zero Waste for a Week booklet of tips, some info on recycling and disposing of hard rubbish, info on composting and worm farms,  a sticker for the recycling bin, a [keep cup][2], and some net bags for the veggie shop and a reusable lunch box. Handy stuff, but it would've been nice to have Green Renters included in the resource list. Hopefully we can rectify that for next year's challenge?

We do pretty well in general. We have a [worm farm, Bokashi bin][3], green council bin (the bin is for gardening green waste and costs $45 from the council), and we usually produce about 1/3 a small wheelie bin worth of rubbish each week and a half to full bin of recycling. Our green bin is emptied fortnightly and is always full! We don't use plastic bags and take cloth ones where we go. We try not to eat a lot of packaged food in general and don't use glad wrap or stuff like that. We have no children or pets. We generally get hard waste collection once or twice a year.

**Our challenges**

*   We produce more veggie scraps (we're vegetarian, we cook a lot , work from home and grow our own veggies) than our worm farm and Bokashi bin can handle. We'll need to bury some of the scraps this week in our front garden.
*   We eat tofu which is sold in plastic (I've never seen it sold any other way). The plastic container is recyclable but the peel off top isn't.
*   I sell make and sell crafts and  whilst I favour reusing craft materials (old fabric etc), cut threads and bits and pieces like this can't be recycled and they'd cut the worms in half in the worm farm!I do have an intention to make some soft toys for a charity drive coming up however, so I might use the scraps as stuffing.
*   We live in on a busy street and invariably get other people's rubbish flying into the garden, including non-recycled crap from the McDonalds at the other end of our street. We clean up other people's rubbish everyday.

I'm going to post a bit each day as well as do an audit at the end of the week of all our rubbish to see what we have. Should be interesting!

Day 2

The meringues came in a clear plastic bag within a recycled box, the plastic obviously being non-recycled.  I was tempted to ask them to take them home but decided that was cheating! I've been told meringues are quite easy to make. We don't do much cooking with eggs and tend to use vegan egg replacement for most recipes. But I did find this lovely photo and recipe for meringues from the BBC food website. I also wonder what is the lesser evil in terms of environmental footprint, to use free range eggs and discard the yolks (as we don't eat them and they'd simply have to be discarded) or use the frozen egg whites from the freezer section of the supermarket which presumably come from battery hens and are from overseas. The ethical choice is clear but not the environmental one in terms of food waste.

It is also possible to make vegan meringues, but all the blogs I've read suggest they are very difficult.

We drank boxed wine, this is a bit problematic as the plastic bladder can't be recycled. I did a bit of a search on the Internet as to uses of wine bladders. I found a website which featured a rather bizarre keyboard which is usually operated with a mouth pump which has been turned into a blow keyboard with a foot pump. I'm not sure what else I can say about it really.

Day 3      

I bought my own cutlery and carried lunch in plastic containers in a cloth bag and was a bit peeved when they leaked. It's always the beetroot! Still, no great dramas luckily. We do have a box of zip lock plastic bags which we use mostly for freezing things. We wash and reuse the bags so they last ages, next time I'll 'double bag' the salad.

I made a heap of my own cloth bags a few years ago using this tutorial. They're a good alternative to the green shopping bags and I made them in lots of different colours. I use them mostly for shopping and trips to the library.

After work  I went and had a few drinks and dinner with some friends and Chris. Silver cutlery was great but the ubiquitous paper napkins appeared, wrapped around the cutlery. So annoying! We're a big fan of the UK campaign Take Out Without and I try to bring my own cloth napkin when I remember! We also use our handkerchiefs at home instead of tissues which saves us money but also the cutting down of trees obviously. I gocco printed a heap of handkerchiefs recently for an exhibition...

Day 4

I went to buy some fetta for a recipe (a vegan version of the recipe is featured here on my craft blog) I was intending to cook to use up some of the silver beet and broad beans in our garden. They've been growing rather prolific thanks to the rain and we have plenty to either use, freeze or give away!

At the supermarket I had the choice of fetta from the deli (wrapped in plastic and again in paper) or from the cold dairy section (vacuum sealed in non-recyclable plastic). I wondered which was the lesser evil and decided to go with the deli. I asked at the deli if I could supply a container to put the cheese in but they said they weren't allowed to do that for health reasons. I realised with hindsight that I could have asked for them to use one of the plastic deli containers but we really don't need any more of them, we have plenty which we reuse.

Upon starting to make the triangle pastries I remembered that the frozen puff pastry had a thin piece of blue plastic between each piece of puff pastry. I didn't have time to make my own pastry but I've since done a search on the internet and I'm going to give this recipe a go, using Nuttlex instead of lard.

The silverbeet and broad beans resulted in a lot of veggie scraps and as our worm farm and bokashi bin are both full, I decided to put them in the green bin as to be fair, they have come from our garden! It was 8pm and I was tired and didn't feel like burying them in a hole!

Day 5                         

I do try to minimise waste but I have decided to assist this by cutting out my plastic with a template to ensure more even sizing and less going in the bin. I know this is not necessarily a problem relevant to most households, but it's a common one for us crafty folk! It can be hard to avoid the temptation of buying craft materials instead of using what is currently available, something I have been trying to work on over the years in my business but I am as guilty as anyone else to fall into the temptation of feeling validated by the mighty consumerism. I am also by nature a very messy person. It is often easier to buy something to replace something lost than find the original item you were looking for! I read a book about messiness recently and found that I am certainly not the only person who does this. Chris often helps me to tidy the craft room, half of which is his office and it's amazing how many unearthed items are rediscovered.

I also have been organising myself for the Northcote Kris Kringle Market. Markets mean a lot of  emphasis is placed on presentation at market stalls. I travel light as a rule as I don't drive which minimises the amount of stock and assorted paraphernalia I can bring along with me.

Day 6     

Our council accepts plastic bottle caps as part of their recycling program but I understand this is not the case at all local council waste management programs. At any rate, they can always be saved and collected to donate to kindergartens and child care centres.

I had a go at making a bottle of non-alcoholic ginger beer recently. It went very well until I opened it and it blew up all over me! It tasted nice but about half the bottle was alas lost in the explosion. I'm keen to try making some alcoholic ginger beer in the summer using ginger root as the feeder. Will be reporting back.

Day 7

I opened up the bin, and took out the contents to photograph. Besides some rather unsavory fruit peelings that didn't fit in the worm farm/Bokashi bin, here's what we ended up with from the kitchen. All food packets! The obvious answer is to shop at a whole foods service where we can use paper bags, this is definitely something I'd like to do when we are in a better financial position. I realise we could also make our own bread, but financially it isn't viable as we simply don't eat enough bread to cover the cost of a bread maker! We could also look at making our own yogurt and yogurt based cheese in the future though I'd need some time to put these into practice.

Some other things I have learnt:

*   Reduce craft waste

I forgot to photograph my craft bin but it was definitely full. More care in cutting materials will hopefully reduce my waste in this area.

*   Make own pastry and crackers
*   <span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Find a deli retailer who accepts own plastic containers for cheese, dips etc.</span>
*   Make own gingerbeer
*   Continuing using Bokashi bin and worm farm

All in all, the week wasn't very difficult but shopping took a bit longer than normal. I like cooking and I think I could spend some time making a few things from scratch rather than buying them ready made. We like having people over for meals and barbecues and the like and it means they tend to bring packaged goods with them. I'm not sure I want to be telling people they can't pick up something quick at the supermarket on the way over  but I could certainly start a dialogue with others about how they reduce their waste in the home, particularly when it comes to food packaging.

P.S. *The Age* newspaper arrived today (we have a weekend subscription) in plastic wrap which is annoying. I'm going to rinse it out and see if I can think what to do with it…
