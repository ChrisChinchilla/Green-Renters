Use very ripe tomatoes for the best flavour. If you can afford to buy good quality vinegar, such as apple cider vinegar, do so. Otherwise you can just use cheap white vinegar but it will give your chutney a slightly tarter flavour. Feel free to play around with the recipe, adding your favourite spices, or varying the spice quantities, until you find the combination that works best for you. Serve in sandwiches and burgers, with curries, or anywhere that you would use tomato sauce.

**For each kilo of tomatoes that you use add: **

*   2 large red capsicums, diced 4 medium onions
*   diced 4 medium cloves of garlic, diced 2 red chillies, seeded and diced (add more if you like your chutney hot)
*   2 tablespoon black mustard seeds
*   2 tablespoons paprika
*   1 tablespoon ground cumin
*   1 tablespoon ground coriander
*   1 tablespoon salt
*   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
*   2 cups white or cider vinegar
*   1 cup sugar

**Method:**

1.  Dice tomatoes and place in a large heavy bottomed pot along with the diced capsicum, onions, garlic, chilli and the spices.
2.  Pour in the vinegar and sugar, and place over medium-high heat.
3.  Stir well to ensure that the sugar is dissolved and bring to the boil.
4.  Lower to a medium heat and allow to simmer for 1.5 â€“ 2 hours, until the tomato has collapsed and the chutney has reduced and thickened.
5.  Remember to stir regularly to prevent it from sticking to the pan and burning. It's a good idea to taste the chutney after an hour or so and see if you need to add some more spices or salt.
6.  Pour into hot sterilised jars and seal immediately.
7.  Label and then store in a cool, dark place for up to a year.
8.  Refrigerate chutney once opened.
