Lemon butter is a great way to use up excess lemons this time of year. It is delicious served on scones with cream, in tarts or between two biscuits.  
It also livens up any leftover cake you might have lurking around.

*Ingredients:*

*   8 lemons
*   500g sugar
*   250g butter
*   6 eggs beaten

1.  Wash lemons and grate rind.
2.  Squeeze lemon juice
3.  In a saucepan melt butter and add sugar.
4.  Stir well (I use a whisk to avoid lumps)
5.  Stir when and when melted add the lemon zest and juice
6.  Add eggs
7.  Stir/whisk until smooth and thickened. it should take about 20 minutes.
8.  Pour into hot sterilised jars and seal

Mixture will thicken upon cooling.

Makes two 500g jars. Store your lemon butter in the fridge, it should be eaten within a month.
