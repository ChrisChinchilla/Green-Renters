Besides this site, there are very few resources out there on how to be a green renter. There are a million articles out there on how to be green and an environmentally friendly homeowner though. I live in a rental apartment building in New York City, so I can't install solar panels on my roof or wrap up my water heater (I don't even have a thermostat). There are still things that I can do to minimize my impact on the environment.

Over the past few months, I started to document these things on some blogs that I created. I saw it as an opportunity to show people what can not only be done, but be done in a simple manner. Our lives don't have to be totally rearranged.

My current projects are:  
<a href="http://www.urbanorganicgardener.com/" target="_blank">UrbanOrganicGardener</a>: I'm doing organic gardening on my fire escape in Manhattan and in my Grandmother's backyard in Brooklyn.  
<a href="http://www.simplyrawrecipes.com/" target="_blank">SimplyRawRecipes</a>: I'm often labeled a raw food vegan because I eat whole, uncooked fruits and vegetables. The reason I started it is because people constantly ask me, "What do you eat?"  
<a href="http://www.365waystogogreen.com/" target="_blank">365WaysToGoGreen</a>: Each day for a year I plan to document one simple green act that I did for the day.

With that being said, I want to share with you my Top 10 List of Things You Can Do As A Green Renter:

1.  Set up plants in your apartment. Not only will they add vibrancy, but they'll help to clean the air.
2.  Adjust the temperature of your refrigerator and freezer. As a renter, you can't buy a new Energy Star fridge, but you can adjust temperature level. The EPA recommends keeping refrigerators at 37 degrees F and freezers at 3 degrees. Anything colder is probably overkill, and a waste of energy.
3.  Turn off devices and appliances that aren't in use such as ceiling or oscillating fans.
4.  Not only should you turn them off, but you should unplug your electronic devices when you're not using them or going away for a few hours. Even though the device is off it still sucks energy. This is known as the "phantom load."
5.  Take the stairs. According to <a href="http://creativecitizen.com/" target="_blank">CreativeCitizen</a>, “Per floor (one direction, 3 meters): 2.5 Wh. That is approximately 1/2 the amount of energy it takes to recharge a cellphone battery.”
6.  Use an old toothbrush to wash dishes with those hard to reach spots.
7.  Use an old t-shirt to dust and wipe off countertops.
8.  Reuse an empty cereal box to store items such as recipes, plastic bags or seasoning packets.
9.  Turn off the faucet while you are shaving of brushing your teeth.
10. 10.After each season, when you change out your clothes donate the ones that you didn't wear all season.

**Bonus Things You Can Do**  
Start your own garden in your apartment on your fire escape, balcony or window sill. The space is there, you just need to utilize it. Once you have your garden set up, then you can start your own worm composting bin. This will help keep your food scraps from the landfill and supply you with fresh soil for your garden. If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up. You don't have to own a home to make environmentally sound decisions about your living space. There are many simple things that you can do be a green renter.
