Did you know that bread is the most common foods thrown out at home? I bought a fancy loaf of artisan pumpkin bread recently and noticed that despite careful storage, it went dry in a couple of days. Supermarket bought bread lasts a lot longer but I can't help wondering the side effects of the additives which extend it's longevity.

Tips for making it last longer:

*   Keep your bread as fresh as possible by stopping moisture loss. Sliced bread should last for two to five days when stored in its wrapper, in a bread box or on a dry airy shelf in the cupboard. Storing bread in the refrigerator is not recommended as bread can become stale quickly at low temperatures.
*   For longer than five days, the freezer is the best place to store bread. Freezing does not affect its nutritional value and you can successfully freeze bread for up to three months. It is best to freeze bread quickly and seal it tightly with as little air in the bag as possible.
*   If you only eat a small amount of bread, then freeze it when you get home and take out a few slices a couple of hours before you need them.

Making breadcrumbs is also a great way to extend the use of leftover bread: it can provide a crispy coating to fish, a crunch to the top of a pasta bake or add bulk and binding to a meat loaf or nutloaf. Try different types of bread with finely chopped herbs for variety.
