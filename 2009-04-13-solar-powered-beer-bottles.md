An enterprising (and heavy beer drinking) Chinese man has found a novel way to warm water suitable for showering and washing that would work exceptionally well in a hot country such as Australia. He connected 66 beer bottles together with pipes that allows free flow of water, sunlight heats the water inside the bottles and is passed into the bathroom, assuming the outside temperature is warm enough the resulting water should be suitable for a comfortable shower. If you were willing to use something like a hose head for the shower head then this could easily be adapted to a rental property, also you could consider wrapping the bottles in some form of insulation material to keep the water warm as the temperature cools.
