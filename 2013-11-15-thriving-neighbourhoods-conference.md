<span style="line-height: 1.5;">We were asked to speak at this years 'Thriving Neighbourhoods' conference and here are our thoughts on the two days… It's a little stream of consciousness and is more of a dump of tips and ideas I picked up.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Robert Doyle</strong> turns out to be a better mayor than (maybe) we all expected, his opening address focused on how cities act quicker than nations and are often found doing the best work,  despite most people's experience of local government. Ensuring no resident is no more than 300m from a decent green space, filling in gaps that are unused. A lot of this is adding towards green canopy policy to reduce heat effects.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Robert Hammond, the high line</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">The Highline takes an abandoned structure and is turning it into a public green space. Not having relevant experience was a benefit. Finding the communities that support your idea. Despite all the positive ideas you will still need to also provide statistical support. How could existing laws and policies support you. Having a dialogue with the community didn't mean you have to follow it, but explain why you don't. Create projects that encourage other projects. Be careful not to alienate existing or old communities. Leave space for other people and random ideas to organically happen.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Economic case for creating thriving neighbourhoods</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Create economic analysis that can be utilised as a tool by others. Acknowledge the reality of a situation. Focus on the real and main economic factors.</span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Bank Mecu are a great example of a big business doing good in the community, part of a growing trend. Negatives for other businesses lead to positives for them.</span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Plan Melbourne - Melbourne's planning framework for the next few decades. </span><a href="http://www.planmelbourne.vic.gov.au/Plan-Melbourne" target="_blank">www.planmelbourne.vic.gov.au/Plan-Melbourne</a>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Alternative housing - Cooperative housing, not a new concept to us, see <a href="http://greenrenters.org/story/cohousing-murundaka" target="_blank">Cohousing in Murundaka</a> for more on this topic.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>West Brunswick Community garden</strong><br /> More leanings towards a more open community approach, does that suit everyone? A lot of trust and will it work over time?</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Cooperative city planning</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Health becoming a more recurring subject in urban plans,  healthy food often missing, healthy rentals? Still not being mentioned explicitly anywhere.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>S(c)ensory renewal</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Gentrification is a commercial commodity, not as open as it seems. Senses are not taken into account enough with urban planning, especially when perceived together. Or paying attention to the city around you.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Creative suburbs</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Sounds like a lot of other services around. My main issue with the is the potential for integration and exportable.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Shop houses</strong><br /> These are everywhere, not sure why this is being touted as something new. Especially with the decline of high streets.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Temporary public spaces</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Responsive spaces to changing needs, or a cheap option. Again 'space' for the community. what about when they leave? They do offer opportune to revisit ideas and intentions.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Mapmytown</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><a href="http://www.victoriawalks.org.au/Assets/Files/MapMyTown%20Bendigo%20walk%20cycle%20poster%20April%202013%20web.pdf" target="_blank">Plan b </a>at Bendigo last trobe campus. Mapping walking and cycling routes but not how the crow flies, on the ground.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Winners from festival of ideas</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Will we just be solving short term problems or working towards larger goals. Problems - apathy, differences of opinion, zero as an end state, sacrifice and compromise. Is targeting the majority first the best approach, target the thought leaders first.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Mayor of Adelaide</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Consultation by doing, quick, agile and easy. Don't impinge on existing businesses. Acknowledge who is using your city space and what they want. Parking days, 80% of a city can be roadways, how else could they be used? Moving people not cars. Smart move Adelaide. Make controversial infrastructure projects attractive, gives more leverage if people complain. Global cycling conference.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Flinders Island</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">A collection of islands in the bass Strait of 800 people. Tourism, agriculture, niche products. Lacking in economies of scale without government support, which has small resources. Everything is large when you're small. You often need to subsidise things to provide essential services and collecting charges from small populations is often not worth it.</span>

<span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>City West water</strong></span>  
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Challenges to the west. Hotter and dryer than other areas of Melbourne and worst air quality in Brooklyn. Greening the west, living Brooklyn.</span>
