  <strong>Fermenting Revolution (How to drink beer and save the world)<br /> Christopher Mark O'Brien</strong>
</p>

  I love Beer for many reasons, but especially because I love the way I can travel around the world and try a completely different brew in every town that I wont find elsewhere. It seems that Christopher Mark O'Brien is one man who loves beer as much as I do, in fact, quite possibly, a lot more than I do

  This book is an enthusiastically written documentation all about beer, it's History, it's culture, it's health benefits, it's present, it's future and how so many small breweries across the world are helping their community and the world.

  The Author's sheer passion for his subject is hard to dislike and I found myself tearing through this book in rapid time, enjoying every moment and discovering many fascinating nuggets of information.

  For example did you know that beer has been around for an incredibly long time and was created as a palatable substitute for water, not only that, but drinking quality (i.e. fairly naturally made) beer in moderation is pretty good for you, containing many beneficial nutrients. Also, that until the industrial revolution, beer was generally brewed by small local breweries and by women, in fact for a substance that is more recently associated with men, it's past is most definitely feminine.

  Now that microbreweries are rapidly cropping up around the world and are experiencing great and deserved success, it's refreshing and illuminating to read about so many of them following strict environmental practices and bringing the wonders of beer drinking firmly back into the friendly, sociable, community bonding activity it always was until it's recent corruption into a bland mainstream fuel for macho violence.
