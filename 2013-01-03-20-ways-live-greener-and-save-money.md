I love this clever little image clipped from the web. With the number of new gidgets, gadets and what nots, it isn't surprising that there appears to be a common misconception that going green means spending more of our hard earned money. Here are 20 EASY MONEY SAVING tips that will not only help you contribute to a positive environmental impact but  keep you from breaking the bank at the same time.

1.  **Buy in bulk**
2.  **Library instead of bookshop. **If technology has its way, your local library will soon be an endangered species. Most local libraries offer free membership and carry a plethera of resources including recent bestsellers, news and magazines and media including CD, DVD and various other online media options.
3.  **Learn to ride a bike**
4.  **Turn off powerpoints when not in use** - Ok, so there are some pretty cool techno gadgets to help monitor and reduce our electricty usage. But households can easily take the first step with no initial investment simply by turning off powerpoints when not in use. To make it easier - consider plugging clock based mechanisms into a separate powerpoint or powerboard from other appliances. This can allow you to turn off entire powerboards (like yout TV, SoundSystem, DVD player) without the inconvience of losing track of time. It is estimated that a family of four can waste hundreds of dollars just on leaking power alone.

5.  **Make your own lunch** - In addition to it being made exactly to your taste. Making your own lunch not only save you money in your lunchbox, it also reduces the consumption of takeaway materials and food wastage.
6.  **Store leftovers properly - **Most mothers will tell you, if  you are throwing food away, there is something wrong. Ensure you store leftovers sealed in containers and use within appropriate timeframes. Consider making leftover lunches or freezing them in manageable quanities to save on wastage and the hip pocket.
7.  **Make your own cleaning products** - not so hard as it sounds AND you have the satisfaction of knowing exactly what you and your household is being exposed to. There are thousands of websites that offer step by sep tutorials on a range of house and personal cleaning products OR invest in one of our workshops!
8.  **Hold a clothing swap** - Newcastle NSW recently had a great day at the local civic centre. Themed on "Raid my Wardrobe" it was a day of swap and sell encouraging the reuse of quality clothing. Hold a clothing swap of your own, either with friends over popcorn and a movie or one on one. If you have little ones, talk with the school about hosting a kid swap, which might include clothing, toys and other goodies - all for a swap - "One man's trash..." so they say.
9.  **Learn to mend your own clothes** - the power of a thread and needle. Consider yourself, how many pieces of clothing have you failed to salvage that if you simply knew a few mending techniques you could have saved for another season. have a look online for cheap and easy mending techniques.
10. ****hold a garage sale - ****the failproof way to make quick cash and save the environment! Forget waiting for the free tip pass from council, and instead host your own garage sale. Once finished, separate any leftover items into donate, recycle, and rubbish. You may be surprised to see how much money you can make and how little rubbish you actually have.** **
11. **buy seasonal produce**
12. **free entertainment - **Have a look on your local and state websites to view free activities on in your area. Or grab a cricket bat or guitar and create your own

16. **turn lights off when not in use - **one would think this a no brainer, but...
