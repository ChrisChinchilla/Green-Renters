This is an issue I have been pondering quite a bit recently myself... Personally I feel that if Cyclists did pay a road tax, then we may get more respect from other road usersÂ  who frequently consider cyclists to be lower class citizens because we don't pay a license fee. I'm perfectly aware that most of car driver's road tax actually goes on admin and to Hospitals for cleaning up the mess they leave behind, but I consider it more of a levelling tax than anything else. I have also been wondering if some sort of licensing test for cyclist would be in order, because as far as I'm concerned, the increase in cyclists has also led to an increase in the amount of dangerous, inconsiderate and frankly stupid cyclists...

Anyway, that's a discussion for the future, in the meantime, have a read of <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2009/04/should-cyclists-pay-road-tax.php" target="_blank">this article</a> on TreeHugger.
